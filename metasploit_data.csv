Type,Module,Description
exploit,aix/local/ibstat_path,"This module exploits the trusted $PATH environment variable of the SUID binary ""ibstat""."
exploit,aix/local/xorg_x11_server,"WARNING: Successful execution of this module results in /etc/passwd being overwritten. This module is a port of the OpenBSD X11 Xorg exploit to run on AIX. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with AIX 7.1 and 7.2, and should also work with 6.1. Due to permission restrictions of the crontab in AIX, this module does not use cron, and instead overwrites /etc/passwd in order to create a new user with root privileges. All currently logged in users need to be included when /etc/passwd is overwritten, else AIX will throw 'Cannot get ""LOGNAME"" variable' when attempting to change user. The Xorg '-fp' parameter used in the OpenBSD exploit does not work on AIX, and is replaced by '-config', in conjuction with ANSI-C quotes to inject newlines when overwriting /etc/passwd."
exploit,aix/rpc_cmsd_opcode21,"This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in opcode 21 handled by rpc.cmsd on AIX. By making a request with a long string passed to the first argument of the ""rtable_create"" RPC, a stack based buffer overflow occurs. This leads to arbitrary code execution. NOTE: Unsuccessful attempts may cause inetd/portmapper to enter a state where further attempts are not possible."
exploit,aix/rpc_ttdbserverd_realpath,This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in _tt_internal_realpath function of the ToolTalk database server (rpc.ttdbserverd).
exploit,android/adb/adb_server_exec,Writes and spawns a native payload on an android device that is listening for adb debug messages.
exploit,android/browser/samsung_knox_smdm_url,"A vulnerability exists in the KNOX security component of the Samsung Galaxy firmware that allows a remote webpage to install an APK with arbitrary permissions by abusing the 'smdm://' protocol handler registered by the KNOX component. The vulnerability has been confirmed in the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, and Ace 4."
exploit,android/browser/stagefright_mp4_tx3g_64bit,"This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Stagefright Library (libstagefright.so). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow. This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First, we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically. NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in permissive mode."
exploit,android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface,"This module exploits a privilege escalation issue in Android < 4.2's WebView component that arises when untrusted Javascript code is executed by a WebView that has one or more Interfaces added to it. The untrusted Javascript code can call into the Java Reflection APIs exposed by the Interface and execute arbitrary commands. Some distributions of the Android Browser app have an addJavascriptInterface call tacked on, and thus are vulnerable to RCE. The Browser app in the Google APIs 4.1.2 release of Android is known to be vulnerable. A secondary attack vector involves the WebViews embedded inside a large number of Android applications. Ad integrations are perhaps the worst offender here. If you can MITM the WebView's HTTP connection, or if you can get a persistent XSS into the page displayed in the WebView, then you can inject the html/js served by this module and get a shell. Note: Adding a .js to the URL will return plain javascript (no HTML markup)."
exploit,android/fileformat/adobe_reader_pdf_js_interface,Adobe Reader versions less than 11.2.0 exposes insecure native interfaces to untrusted javascript in a PDF. This module embeds the browser exploit from android/webview_addjavascriptinterface into a PDF to get a command shell on vulnerable versions of Reader.
exploit,android/local/binder_uaf,"This module exploits CVE-2019-2215, which is a use-after-free in Binder in the Android kernel. The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious website. The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading and writing of kernel memory."
exploit,android/local/futex_requeue,"This module exploits a bug in futex_requeue in the Linux kernel, using similar techniques employed by the towelroot exploit. Any Android device with a kernel built before June 2014 is likely to be vulnerable."
exploit,android/local/janus,"This module exploits CVE-2017-13156 in Android to install a payload into another application. The payload APK will have the same signature and can be installed as an update, preserving the existing data. The vulnerability was fixed in the 5th December 2017 security patch, and was additionally fixed by the APK Signature scheme v2, so only APKs signed with the v1 scheme are vulnerable. Payload handler is disabled, and a multi/handler must be started first."
exploit,android/local/put_user_vroot,"This module exploits a missing check in the get_user and put_user API functions in the linux kernel before 3.5.5. The missing checks on these functions allow an unprivileged user to read and write kernel memory. This exploit first reads the kernel memory to identify the commit_creds and ptmx_fops address, then uses the write primitive to execute shellcode as uid 0. The exploit was first discovered in the wild in the vroot rooting application."
exploit,android/local/su_exec,"This module uses the su binary present on rooted devices to run a payload as root. A rooted Android device will contain a su binary (often linked with an application) that allows the user to run commands as root. This module will use the su binary to execute a command stager as root. The command stager will write a payload binary to a temporary directory, make it executable, execute it in the background, and finally delete the executable. On most devices the su binary will pop-up a prompt on the device asking the user for permission."
exploit,apple_ios/browser/safari_jit,"This module exploits a JIT optimization bug in Safari Webkit. This allows us to write shellcode to an RWX memory section in JavaScriptCore and execute it. The shellcode contains a kernel exploit (CVE-2016-4669) that obtains kernel rw, obtains root and disables code signing. Finally we download and execute the meterpreter payload. This module has been tested against iOS 7.1.2 on an iPhone 4."
exploit,apple_ios/browser/safari_libtiff,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in the version of libtiff shipped with firmware versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.1.1 of the Apple iPhone. iPhones which have not had the BSD tools installed will need to use a special payload."
exploit,apple_ios/browser/webkit_createthis,"This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The type confusion leads to the ability to allocate fake Javascript objects, as well as the ability to find the address in memory of a Javascript object. This allows us to construct a fake JSCell object that can be used to read and write arbitrary memory from Javascript. The module then uses a ROP chain to write the first stage shellcode into executable memory within the Safari process and kick off its execution. The first stage maps the second stage macho (containing CVE-2017-13861) into executable memory, and jumps to its entrypoint. The CVE-2017-13861 async_wake exploit leads to a kernel task port (TFP0) that can read and write arbitrary kernel memory. The processes credential and sandbox structure in the kernel is overwritten and the meterpreter payloads code signature hash is added to the kernels trust cache, allowing Safari to load and execute the (self-signed) meterpreter payload."
exploit,apple_ios/browser/webkit_trident,This module exploits a UAF vulnerability in WebKit's JavaScriptCore library.
exploit,apple_ios/email/mobilemail_libtiff,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in the version of libtiff shipped with firmware versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.1.1 of the Apple iPhone. iPhones which have not had the BSD tools installed will need to use a special payload."
exploit,apple_ios/ssh/cydia_default_ssh,This module exploits the default credentials of Apple iOS when it has been jailbroken and the passwords for the 'root' and 'mobile' users have not been changed.
exploit,bsd/finger/morris_fingerd_bof,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in fingerd on 4.3BSD. This vulnerability was exploited by the Morris worm in 1988-11-02. Cliff Stoll reports on the worm in the epilogue of The Cuckoo's Egg. Currently, only bsd/vax/shell_reverse_tcp is supported."
exploit,bsdi/softcart/mercantec_softcart,This is an exploit for an undisclosed buffer overflow in the SoftCart.exe CGI as shipped with Mercantec's shopping cart software. It is possible to execute arbitrary code by passing a malformed CGI parameter in an HTTP GET request. This issue is known to affect SoftCart version 4.00b.
exploit,dialup/multi/login/manyargs,This exploit connects to a system's modem over dialup and exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in it's System V derived /bin/login. The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large number of arguments.
exploit,firefox/local/exec_shellcode,"This module allows execution of native payloads from a privileged Firefox Javascript shell. It places the specified payload into memory, adds the necessary protection flags, and calls it, which can be useful for upgrading a Firefox javascript shell to a Meterpreter session without touching the disk."
exploit,freebsd/ftp/proftp_telnet_iac,"This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code."
exploit,freebsd/http/citrix_dir_traversal_rce,"This module exploits a directory traversal in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC), aka NetScaler, and Gateway 10.5, 11.1, 12.0, 12.1, and 13.0, to execute an arbitrary command payload."
exploit,freebsd/http/watchguard_cmd_exec,"This module exploits two separate vulnerabilities found in the Watchguard XCS virtual appliance to gain command execution. By exploiting an unauthenticated SQL injection, a remote attacker may insert a valid web user into the appliance database, and get access to the web interface. On the other hand, a vulnerability in the web interface allows the attacker to inject operating system commands as the 'nobody' user."
exploit,freebsd/local/intel_sysret_priv_esc,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel, when running on 64-bit Intel processors. By design, 64-bit processors following the X86-64 specification will trigger a general protection fault (GPF) when executing a SYSRET instruction with a non-canonical address in the RCX register. However, Intel processors check for a non-canonical address prior to dropping privileges, causing a GPF in privileged mode. As a result, the current userland RSP stack pointer is restored and executed, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE (amd64); and FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE (amd64)."
exploit,freebsd/local/ip6_setpktopt_uaf_priv_esc,This module exploits a race and use-after-free vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel IPv6 socket handling. A missing synchronization lock in the `IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS` option handling in `setsockopt` permits racing `ip6_setpktopt` access to a freed `ip6_pktopts` struct. This exploit overwrites the `ip6po_pktinfo` pointer of a `ip6_pktopts` struct in freed memory to achieve arbitrary kernel read/write. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE #0 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE #0 r243825 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE #0 r255898 (amd64); FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE #0 r268512 (amd64); FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE r341666 (amd64); and FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE r354233 (amd64).
exploit,freebsd/local/mmap,"This module exploits a vulnerability that can be used to modify portions of a process's address space, which may lead to privilege escalation. Systems such as FreeBSD 9.0 and 9.1 are known to be vulnerable."
exploit,freebsd/local/rtld_execl_priv_esc,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the FreeBSD run-time link-editor (rtld). The rtld `unsetenv()` function fails to remove `LD_*` environment variables if `__findenv()` fails. This can be abused to load arbitrary shared objects using `LD_PRELOAD`, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: FreeBSD 7.2-RELEASE (amd64); and FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE (amd64)."
exploit,freebsd/local/watchguard_fix_corrupt_mail,This module exploits a vulnerability in the Watchguard XCS 'FixCorruptMail' script called by root's crontab which can be exploited to run a command as root within 3 minutes.
exploit,freebsd/misc/citrix_netscaler_soap_bof,"This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability on the Citrix NetScaler Appliance. The vulnerability exists in the SOAP handler, accessible through the web interface. A malicious SOAP requests can force the handler to connect to a malicious NetScaler config server. This malicious config server can send a specially crafted response in order to trigger a memory corruption and overwrite data in the stack, to finally execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server running the SOAP handler. This module has been tested successfully on the NetScaler Virtual Appliance 450010."
exploit,freebsd/samba/trans2open,This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the noexec stack option set.
exploit,freebsd/tacacs/xtacacsd_report,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in XTACACSD <= 4.1.2. By sending a specially crafted XTACACS packet with an overly long username, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code."
exploit,freebsd/telnet/telnet_encrypt_keyid,This module exploits a buffer overflow in the encryption option handler of the FreeBSD telnet service.
exploit,freebsd/webapp/spamtitan_unauth_rce,"TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway is an anti-spam appliance that protects against unwanted emails and malwares. This module exploits an improper input sanitization in versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03 and 7.07 to inject command directives into the SNMP configuration file and get remote code execution as root. Note that only version 7.03 needs authentication and no authentication is required for versions 7.01, 7.02 and 7.07. First, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `snmp-x.php` page with an `SNMPD` command directives (`extend` + command) passed to the `community` parameter. This payload is then added to `snmpd.conf` by the application. Finally, the module triggers the execution of this command by querying the SNMP server for the correct OID. This exploit module has been successfully tested against versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, and 7.07."
exploit,hpux/lpd/cleanup_exec,This exploit abuses an unpublished vulnerability in the HP-UX LPD service. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user. The LPD service is only exploitable when the address of the attacking system can be resolved by the target. This vulnerability was silently patched with the buffer overflow flaws addressed in HP Security Bulletin HPSBUX0208-213.
exploit,irix/lpd/tagprinter_exec,This module exploits an arbitrary command execution flaw in the in.lpd service shipped with all versions of Irix.
exploit,linux/antivirus/escan_password_exec,"This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in the eScan Web Management Console. The vulnerability exists while processing CheckPass login requests. An attacker with a valid username can use a malformed password to execute arbitrary commands. With mwconf privileges, the runasroot utility can be abused to get root privileges. This module has been tested successfully on eScan 5.5-2 on Ubuntu 12.04."
exploit,linux/browser/adobe_flashplayer_aslaunch,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player for Linux, version 10.0.12.36 and 9.0.151.0 and prior. An input validation vulnerability allows command execution when the browser loads a SWF file which contains shell metacharacters in the arguments to the ActionScript launch method. The victim must have Adobe AIR installed for the exploit to work. This module was tested against version 10.0.12.36 (10r12_36)."
exploit,linux/ftp/proftp_sreplace,"This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.2 through 1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the ""sreplace"" function within the ""src/support.c"" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the ""sreplace"" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the ""pr_display_file"" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do ""CWD <writeable directory>"" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005."
exploit,linux/ftp/proftp_telnet_iac,"This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec ""res"" in ""pr_cmd_read""). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time."
exploit,linux/games/ut2004_secure,"This is an exploit for the GameSpy secure query in the Unreal Engine. This exploit only requires one UDP packet, which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast address. Usually, the GameSpy query server listens on port 7787, but you can manually specify the port as well. The RunServer.sh script will automatically restart the server upon a crash, giving us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times."
exploit,linux/http/accellion_fta_getstatus_oauth,"This module exploits a metacharacter shell injection vulnerability in the Accellion File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided 'oauth_token' is passed into a system() call within a mod_perl handler. This module exploits the '/tws/getStatus' endpoint. Other vulnerable handlers include '/seos/find.api', '/seos/put.api', and /seos/mput.api'. This issue was confirmed on version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous versions as well. This issue was fixed in software update FTA_9_11_210."
exploit,linux/http/advantech_switch_bash_env_exec,"This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets the 'ping.sh' CGI script, accessible through the Boa web server on Advantech switches. This module was tested against firmware version 1322_D1.98."
exploit,linux/http/airties_login_cgi_bof,"This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on several Airties routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries to the login cgi with long redirect parameters. The vulnerability doesn't require authentication. This module has been tested successfully on the AirTies_Air5650v3TT_FW_1.0.2.0.bin firmware with emulation. Other versions such as the Air6372, Air5760, Air5750, Air5650TT, Air5453, Air5444TT, Air5443, Air5442, Air5343, Air5342, Air5341, Air5021 are also reported as vulnerable."
exploit,linux/http/alcatel_omnipcx_mastercgi_exec,"This module abuses a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the HTTP management interface of the Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise Communication Server 7.1 and earlier. The Unified Maintenance Tool contains a 'masterCGI' binary which allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands by specifying shell metacharaters as the 'user' within the 'ping' action to obtain 'httpd' user access. This module only supports command line payloads, as the httpd process kills the reverse/bind shell spawn after the HTTP 200 OK response."
exploit,linux/http/alienvault_exec,"This module exploits object injection, authentication bypass and ip spoofing vulnerabilities all together. Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary commands under the context of the root user. By abusing authentication bypass issue on gauge.php lead adversaries to exploit object injection vulnerability which leads to SQL injection attack that leaks an administrator session token. Attackers can create a rogue action and policy that enables to execute operating system commands by using captured session token. As a final step, SSH login attempt with an invalid credentials can trigger a created rogue policy which triggers an action that executes operating system command with root user privileges. This module was tested against following product and versions: AlienVault USM 5.3.0, 5.2.5, 5.0.0, 4.15.11, 4.5.0 AlienVault OSSIM 5.0.0, 4.6.1"
exploit,linux/http/alienvault_sqli_exec,"This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting AlienVault OSSIM versions 4.3.1 and lower. The SQL injection issue can be abused in order to retrieve an active admin session ID. If an administrator level user is identified, remote code execution can be gained by creating a high priority policy with an action containing our payload."
exploit,linux/http/apache_continuum_cmd_exec,"This module exploits a command injection in Apache Continuum <= 1.4.2. By injecting a command into the installation.varValue POST parameter to /continuum/saveInstallation.action, a shell can be spawned."
exploit,linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec,"CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet."
exploit,linux/http/apache_druid_js_rce,"Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript code embedded in various types of requests; however, that feature is disabled by default. In Druid versions prior to `0.20.1`, an authenticated user can send a specially-crafted request that both enables the JavaScript code-execution feature and executes the supplied code all at once, allowing for code execution on the server with the privileges of the Druid Server process. More critically, authentication is not enabled in Apache Druid by default. Tested on the following Apache Druid versions: * 0.15.1 * 0.16.0-iap8 * 0.17.1 * 0.18.0-iap3 * 0.19.0-iap7 * 0.20.0-iap4.1 * 0.20.0 * 0.21.0-iap3"

The application runs in virtual appliance, successful exploitation of this vulnerability yields remote code execution as root on the remote system."
exploit,linux/http/astium_sqli_upload,"This module exploits vulnerabilities found in Astium astium-confweb-2.1-25399 RPM and lower. A SQL Injection vulnerability is used to achieve authentication bypass and gain admin access. From an admin session arbitrary PHP code upload is possible. It is used to add the final PHP payload to ""/usr/local/astium/web/php/config.php"" and execute the ""sudo /sbin/service astcfgd reload"" command to reload the configuration and achieve remote root code execution."
exploit,linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce,"The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly from the POST request to enable a special command mode. This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root. This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it. It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743."
exploit,linux/http/atutor_filemanager_traversal,"This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ATutor on an Apache/PHP setup with display_errors set to On, which can be used to allow us to upload a malicious ZIP file. On the web application, a blacklist verification is performed before extraction, however it is not sufficient to prevent exploitation. You are required to login to the target to reach the vulnerability, however this can be done as a student account and remote registration is enabled by default. Just in case remote registration isn't enabled, this module uses 2 vulnerabilities in order to bypass the authentication: 1. confirm.php Authentication Bypass Type Juggling vulnerability 2. password_reminder.php Remote Password Reset TOCTOU vulnerability"
exploit,linux/http/axis_app_install,"This module exploits the ""Apps"" feature in Axis IP cameras. The feature allows third party developers to upload and execute 'eap' applications on the device. The system does not validate the application comes from a trusted source, so a malicious attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code. The issue has no CVE, although the technique was made public in 2018. This module uploads and executes stageless meterpreter as `root`. Uploading the application requires valid credentials. The default administrator credentials used to be `root:root` but newer firmware versions force users to provide a new password for the `root` user. The module was tested on an Axis M3044-V using the latest firmware (9.80.3.8: December 2021). Although all modules that support the ""Apps"" feature are presumed to be vulnerable."
exploit,linux/http/axis_srv_parhand_rce,This module exploits an auth bypass in .srv functionality and a command injection in parhand to execute code as the root user.
exploit,linux/http/belkin_login_bof,"This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on Belkin Play N750 DB Wireless Dual-Band N+ Router N750 routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries with long 'jump' parameters addressed to the /login.cgi URL, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. This module was tested in an emulated environment, using the version 1.10.16.m of the firmware."
exploit,linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Bludit. A remote user could abuse the uuid parameter in the image upload feature in order to save a malicious payload anywhere onto the server, and then use a custom .htaccess file to bypass the file extension check to finally get remote code execution."
exploit,linux/http/cayin_cms_ntp,"This module exploits an authenticated RCE in Cayin CMS <= 11.0. The RCE is executed in the system_service.cgi file's ntpIp Parameter. The field is limited in size, so repeated requests are made to achieve a larger payload. Cayin CMS-SE is built for Ubuntu 16.04 (20.04 failed to install correctly), so the environment should be pretty set and not dynamic between targets. Results in root level access."
exploit,linux/http/centreon_pollers_auth_rce,"An authenticated user with sufficient administrative rights to manage pollers can use this functionality to execute arbitrary commands remotely. Usually, the miscellaneous commands are used by the additional modules (to perform certain actions), by the scheduler for data processing, etc. This module uses this functionality to obtain a remote shell on the target."
exploit,linux/http/centreon_sqli_exec,"This module exploits several vulnerabilities on Centreon 2.5.1 and prior and Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2 and prior. Due to a combination of SQL injection and command injection in the displayServiceStatus.php component, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as long as there is a valid session registered in the centreon.session table. In order to have a valid session, all it takes is a successful login from anybody. The exploit itself does not require any authentication.

exploit,linux/http/efw_chpasswd_exec,"This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in a web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for locally-defined proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for such an account are required. Command execution will be in the context of the ""nobody"" account, but this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux root account on the system to the value specified by console input once it is executed). The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is vulnerable to the exploit. Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability. Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values if required. Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002). Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083).

Note that versions prior to 5.2.0 will still be marked as being vulnerable however this module does not presently support exploiting these targets. The module uploads a malicious check_ping plugin to the Nagios XI server via /admin/monitoringplugins.php and then executes this plugin by issuing a HTTP GET request to download a system profile from the server. For all supported targets except Linux (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.3.0 and Nagios 5.6.5, both running on CentOS 7. For vulnerable versions before 5.5.0, it may take a significant amount of time for the payload to get back (up to 5 minutes).

exploit,linux/http/xplico_exec,"This module exploits command injection vulnerability. Unauthenticated users can register a new account and then execute a terminal command under the context of the root user. The specific flaw exists within the Xplico, which listens on TCP port 9876 by default. The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. There is a hidden end-point at inside of the Xplico that allow anyone to create a new user. Once the user created through /users/register endpoint, it must be activated via activation e-mail. After the registration Xplico try to send e-mail that contains activation code. Unfortunetly, this e-mail probably not gonna reach to the given e-mail address on most of installation. But it's possible to calculate exactly same token value because of insecure cryptographic random string generator function usage. One of the feature of Xplico is related to the parsing PCAP files. Once PCAP file uploaded, Xplico execute an operating system command in order to calculate checksum of the file. Name of the for this operation is direclty taken from user input and then used at inside of the command without proper input validation."

This can be abused by attackers to conduct an out of bounds read and write in the Linux kernel and therefore achieve arbitrary code execution as the root user. The target system must be compiled with eBPF support and not have kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled set, which prevents unprivileged users from loading eBPF programs into the kernel. Note that if kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled is enabled this module can still be utilized to bypass protections such as SELinux, however the user must already be logged as a privileged user such as root."
exploit,linux/local/cve_2021_3493_overlayfs,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Ubuntu's implementation of overlayfs. The vulnerability is the result of failing to verify the ability of a user to set the attributes in a running executable. Specifically, when Overlayfs sends the set attributes data to the underlying file system via `vfs_setxattr`, it fails to first verify the data by calling `cap_convert_nscap`. This vulnerability was patched by moving the call to `cap_convert_nscap` into the `vfs_setxattr` function that sets the attribute, forcing verification every time the `vfs_setxattr` is called rather than trusting the data was already verified."

exploit,linux/local/cve_2022_0847_dirtypipe,"This exploit targets a vulnerability in the Linux kernel since 5.8, that allows writing of read only or immutable memory. The vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102. The module exploits this vulnerability by overwriting a suid binary with the payload, executing it, and then writing the original data back. There are two major limitations of this exploit: the offset cannot be on a page boundary (it needs to write one byte before the offset to add a reference to this page to the pipe), and the write cannot cross a page boundary. This means the payload must be less than the page size (4096 bytes)."
exploit,linux/local/cve_2022_0995_watch_queue,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's watch_queue event notification system. It relies on a heap out-of-bounds write in kernel memory. The exploit may fail on the first attempt so multiple attempts may be needed. Note that the exploit can potentially cause a denial of service if multiple failed attemps occur, however this is unlikely."
exploit,linux/local/desktop_privilege_escalation,"This module steals the user password of an administrative user on a desktop Linux system when it is entered for unlocking the screen or for doing administrative actions using PolicyKit. Then, it escalates to root privileges using sudo and the stolen user password. It exploits the design weakness that there is no trusted channel for transferring the password from the keyboard to the actual password verification against the shadow file (which is running as root since /etc/shadow is only readable to the root user). Both screensavers (xscreensaver/gnome-screensaver) and PolicyKit use a component running under the current user account to query for the password and then pass it to a setuid-root binary to do the password verification. Therefore, it is possible to inject a password stealer after compromising the user account. Since sudo requires only the user password (and not the root password of the system), stealing the user password of an administrative user directly allows escalating to root privileges. Please note, you have to start a handler as a background job before running this exploit since the exploit will only create a shell when the user actually enters the password (which may be hours after launching the exploit). Using exploit/multi/handler with the option ExitOnSession set to false should do the job."
exploit,linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc,This module uses Diamorphine rootkit's privesc feature using signal 64 to elevate the privileges of arbitrary processes to UID 0 (root).

exploit,linux/local/docker_runc_escape,This module leverages a flaw in `runc` to escape a Docker container and get command execution on the host as root. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2019-5736. It overwrites the `runc` binary with the payload and wait for someone to use `docker exec` to get into the container. This will trigger the payload execution. Note that executing this exploit carries important risks regarding the Docker installation integrity on the target and inside the container ('Side Effects' section in the documentation).
exploit,linux/local/exim4_deliver_message_priv_esc,This module exploits a flaw in Exim versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). Improper validation of recipient address in deliver_message() function in /src/deliver.c may lead to command execution with root privileges (CVE-2019-10149).
exploit,linux/local/glibc_ld_audit_dso_load_priv_esc,"This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by abusing a vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc) dynamic linker. glibc ld.so in versions before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2 does not properly restrict use of the LD_AUDIT environment variable when loading setuid executables. This allows loading arbitrary shared objects from the trusted library search path with the privileges of the suid user. This module uses LD_AUDIT to load the libpcprofile.so shared object, distributed with some versions of glibc, and leverages arbitrary file creation functionality in the library constructor to write a root-owned world-writable file to a system trusted search path (usually /lib). The file is then overwritten with a shared object then loaded with LD_AUDIT resulting in arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on glibc version 2.11.1 on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and version 2.7 on Debian 5.0.4 i386. RHEL 5 is reportedly affected, but untested.

exploit,linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper,"This module exploits an issue in ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c before Linux kernel 5.1.17. This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME."

exploit,linux/misc/tplink_archer_a7_c7_lan_rce,"This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the tdpServer daemon (/usr/bin/tdpServer), running on the router TP-Link Archer A7/C7 (AC1750), hardware version 5, MIPS Architecture, firmware version 190726. The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker on the LAN side of the router, but the attacker does not need any authentication to abuse it. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as root, including downloading and executing a binary from another host. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski). This module was updated in November 2020, after a bypass was discovered for the patch TP-Link issued. The new injection technique works on older firmware too. All firmware versions up to (but excluding) releases 201029 and 201030 are exploitable."
exploit,linux/misc/ueb9_bpserverd,"It was discovered that the Unitrends bpserverd proprietary protocol, as exposed via xinetd, has an issue in which its authentication can be bypassed. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary commands with root privilege on the target system."
exploit,linux/misc/zabbix_server_exec,"This module abuses the ""Command"" trap in Zabbix Server to execute arbitrary commands without authentication. By default the Node ID ""0"" is used, if it doesn't work, the Node ID is leaked from the error message and exploitation retried. According to the vendor versions prior to 1.6.9 are vulnerable. The vulnerability has been successfully tested on Zabbix Server 1.6.7 on Ubuntu 10.04."
exploit,linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_getname,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the yaSSL (1.9.8 and earlier) implementation bundled with MySQL. By sending a specially crafted client certificate, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is present within the CertDecoder::GetName function inside ""taocrypt/src/asn.cpp"". However, the stack buffer that is written to exists within a parent function's stack frame. NOTE: This vulnerability requires a non-default configuration. First, the attacker must be able to pass the host-based authentication. Next, the server must be configured to listen on an accessible network interface. Lastly, the server must have been manually configured to use SSL. The binary from version 5.5.0-m2 was built with /GS and /SafeSEH. During testing on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation. Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature. Although suse11 was mentioned in the original blog post, the binary package they provide does not contain yaSSL or support SSL."
exploit,linux/mysql/mysql_yassl_hello,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the yaSSL (1.7.5 and earlier) implementation bundled with MySQL <= 6.0. By sending a specially crafted Hello packet, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code."
exploit,linux/pop3/cyrus_pop3d_popsubfolders,"This exploit takes advantage of a stack based overflow. Once the stack corruption has occurred it is possible to overwrite a pointer which is later used for a memcpy. This gives us a write anything anywhere condition similar to a format string vulnerability. NOTE: The popsubfolders option is a non-default setting. I chose to overwrite the GOT with my shellcode and return to it. This defeats the VA random patch and possibly other stack protection features. Tested on gentoo-sources Linux 2.6.16. Although Fedora CORE 5 ships with a version containing the vulnerable code, it is not exploitable due to the use of the FORTIFY_SOURCE compiler enhancement"
exploit,linux/postgres/postgres_payload,"On some default Linux installations of PostgreSQL, the postgres service account may write to the /tmp directory, and may source UDF Shared Libraries from there as well, allowing execution of arbitrary code. This module compiles a Linux shared object file, uploads it to the target host via the UPDATE pg_largeobject method of binary injection, and creates a UDF (user defined function) from that shared object. Because the payload is run as the shared object's constructor, it does not need to conform to specific Postgres API versions."
exploit,linux/pptp/poptop_negative_read,"This is an exploit for the Poptop negative read overflow. This will work against versions prior to 1.1.3-b3 and 1.1.3-20030409, but I currently do not have a good way to detect Poptop versions. The server will by default only allow 4 concurrent manager processes (what we run our code in), so you could have a max of 4 shells at once. Using the current method of exploitation, our socket will be closed before we have the ability to run code, preventing the use of Findsock."
exploit,linux/proxy/squid_ntlm_authenticate,"This is an exploit for Squid\'s NTLM authenticate overflow (libntlmssp.c). Due to improper bounds checking in ntlm_check_auth, it is possible to overflow the 'pass' variable on the stack with user controlled data of a user defined length. Props to iDEFENSE for the advisory."
exploit,linux/redis/redis_replication_cmd_exec,This module can be used to leverage the extension functionality added since Redis 4.0.0 to execute arbitrary code. To transmit the given extension it makes use of the feature of Redis which called replication between master and slave.
exploit,linux/samba/chain_reply,"This exploits a memory corruption vulnerability present in Samba versions prior to 3.3.13. When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an ""InputBuffer"" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the ""InputBuffer"", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a ""talloc chunk"" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection. NOTE: It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks for user sessions in the default configuration."
exploit,linux/samba/is_known_pipename,"This module triggers an arbitrary shared library load vulnerability in Samba versions 3.5.0 to 4.4.14, 4.5.10, and 4.6.4. This module requires valid credentials, a writeable folder in an accessible share, and knowledge of the server-side path of the writeable folder. In some cases, anonymous access combined with common filesystem locations can be used to automatically exploit this vulnerability."
exploit,linux/samba/lsa_transnames_heap,"This module triggers a heap overflow in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon. This module uses the TALLOC chunk overwrite method (credit Ramon and Adriano), which only works with Samba versions 3.0.21-3.0.24. Additionally, this module will not work when the Samba ""log level"" parameter is higher than ""2""."
exploit,linux/samba/setinfopolicy_heap,This module triggers a vulnerability in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon because of an error on the PIDL auto-generated code. Making a specially crafted call to SetInformationPolicy to set a PolicyAuditEventsInformation allows to trigger a heap overflow and finally execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The module uses brute force to guess the stackpivot/rop chain or the system() address and redirect flow there in order to bypass NX. The start and stop addresses for brute forcing have been calculated empirically. On the other hand the module provides the StartBrute and StopBrute which allow the user to configure his own addresses.
exploit,linux/samba/trans2open,This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the noexec stack option set. NOTE: Some older versions of RedHat do not seem to be vulnerable since they apparently do not allow anonymous access to IPC.
exploit,linux/smtp/apache_james_exec,"This module exploits a vulnerability that exists due to a lack of input validation when creating a user. Messages for a given user are stored in a directory partially defined by the username. By creating a user with a directory traversal payload as the username, commands can be written to a given directory. To use this module with the cron exploitation method, run the exploit using the given payload, host, and port. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed within 60 seconds. Due to differences in how cron may run in certain Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, it may be preferable to set the target to Bash Completion as the cron method may not work. If the target is set to Bash completion, start a listener using the given payload, host, and port before running the exploit. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed when a user logs into the system. For this exploitation method, bash completion must be enabled to gain code execution. This exploitation method will leave an Apache James mail object artifact in the /etc/bash_completion.d directory and the malicious user account."
exploit,linux/smtp/exim4_dovecot_exec,"This module exploits a command injection vulnerability against Dovecot with Exim using the ""use_shell"" option.

exploit,multi/browser/firefox_queryinterface,"This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in the Mozilla Firefox browser. To reliably exploit this vulnerability, we need to fill almost a gigabyte of memory with our nop sled and payload. This module has been tested on OS X 10.3 with the stock Firefox 1.5.0 package."
exploit,multi/browser/firefox_svg_plugin,"This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 17 and 17.0.1, provided the user has installed Flash. No memory corruption is used. First, a Flash object is cloned into the anonymous content of the SVG ""use"" element in the <body> (CVE-2013-0758). From there, the Flash object can navigate a child frame to a URL in the chrome:// scheme. Then a separate exploit (CVE-2013-0757) is used to bypass the security wrapper around the child frame's window reference and inject code into the chrome:// context. Once we have injection into the chrome execution context, we can write the payload to disk, chmod it (if posix), and then execute. Note: Flash is used here to trigger the exploit but any Firefox plugin with script access should be able to trigger it."
exploit,multi/browser/firefox_tostring_console_injection,This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 15-22 by abusing two separate Javascript-related vulnerabilities to ultimately inject malicious Javascript code into a context running with chrome:// privileges.
exploit,multi/browser/firefox_webidl_injection,This exploit gains remote code execution on Firefox 22-27 by abusing two separate privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Firefox's Javascript APIs.
exploit,multi/browser/firefox_xpi_bootstrapped_addon,"This exploit dynamically creates a .xpi addon file. The resulting bootstrapped Firefox addon is presented to the victim via a web page. The victim's Firefox browser will pop a dialog asking if they trust the addon. Once the user clicks ""install"", the addon is installed and executes the payload with full user permissions. As of Firefox 4, this will work without a restart as the addon is marked to be ""bootstrapped"". As the addon will execute the payload after each Firefox restart, an option can be given to automatically uninstall the addon once the payload has been executed."
exploit,multi/browser/itms_overflow,"This modules exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in iTunes itms:// URL parsing. It is accessible from the browser and in Safari, itms urls will be opened in iTunes automatically. Because iTunes is multithreaded, only vfork-based payloads should be used."

exploit,multi/http/cve_2021_35464_forgerock_openam,This module leverages a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenAM identity and access management solution. The vulnerability arises from a Java deserialization flaw in OpenAM’s implementation of the Jato framework and can be triggered by a simple one-line GET or POST request to a vulnerable endpoint. Successful exploitation yields code execution on the target system as the service user. This vulnerability also affects the ForgeRock identity platform which is built on top of OpenAM and is thus is susceptible to the same issue.
exploit,multi/http/dexter_casinoloader_exec,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in the command and control panel used to control Dexter (Point of Sale malware). This is done by accessing the PHP page used by bots to report in (gateway.php) which does not sanitize input. Input is encrypted and encoded, but the key is supplied by the bot connecting. The 'page' parameter is used in this case. The command and control panel designates a location to upload files, and can be used as a reliable location to write a PHP shell. Authentication is not needed to exploit this vulnerability."
exploit,multi/http/drupal_drupageddon,"This module exploits the Drupal HTTP Parameter Key/Value SQL Injection (aka Drupageddon) in order to achieve a remote shell on the vulnerable instance. This module was tested against Drupal 7.0 and 7.31 (was fixed in 7.32). Two methods are available to trigger the PHP payload on the target: - set TARGET 0: Form-cache PHP injection method (default). This uses the SQLi to upload a malicious form to Drupal's cache, then trigger the cache entry to execute the payload using a POP chain. - set TARGET 1: User-post injection method. This creates a new Drupal user, adds it to the administrators group, enable Drupal's PHP module, grant the administrators the right to bundle PHP code in their post, create a new post containing the payload and preview it to trigger the payload execution."
exploit,multi/http/eaton_nsm_code_exec,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Eaton Network Shutdown Module version <= 3.21, in lib/dbtools.inc which uses unsanitized user input inside a eval() call.

On operating systems which have case-insensitive file systems, like Windows and OS X, Git clients can be convinced to retrieve and overwrite sensitive configuration files in the .git directory which can allow arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable client can be convinced to perform certain actions (for example, a checkout) against a malicious Git repository. A second vulnerability with similar characteristics also exists in both Git and Mercurial clients, on HFS+ file systems (Mac OS X) only, where certain Unicode codepoints are ignorable. The third vulnerability with similar characteristics only affects Mercurial clients on Windows, where Windows ""short names"" (MS-DOS-compatible 8.3 format) are supported. Today this module only truly supports the first vulnerability (Git clients on case-insensitive file systems) but has the functionality to support the remaining two with a little work."
exploit,multi/http/git_lfs_clone_command_exec,"Git clients that support delay-capable clean / smudge filters and symbolic links on case-insensitive file systems are vulnerable to remote code execution while cloning a repository. Usage of clean / smudge filters through Git LFS and a case-insensitive file system changes the checkout order of repository files which enables the placement of a Git hook in the `.git/hooks` directory. By default, this module writes a `post-checkout` script so that the payload will automatically be executed upon checkout of the repository."
exploit,multi/http/git_submodule_command_exec,"This module exploits CVE-2017-1000117, which affects Git version 2.7.5 and lower. A submodule of the form 'ssh://' can be passed parameters from the username incorrectly. This can be used to inject commands to the operating system when the submodule is cloned.

exploit,multi/http/gitea_git_hooks_rce,"This module leverages an insecure setting to get remote code execution on the target OS in the context of the user running Gitea. This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gitea web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. It has been mitigated in version 1.13.0 by setting the Gitea `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` configuration setting to `true` by default. This disables this feature and prevents all users (including admin) from creating custom git hooks. This module has been tested successfully against docker versions 1.12.5, 1.12.6 and 1.13.6 with `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` set to `false`, and on version 1.12.6 on Windows."

exploit,multi/http/horizontcms_upload_exec,"This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to HorizontCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/fileupload`. The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET[""cmd""]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This would be all users in the Admin, Manager and Editor groups if HorizontCMS is configured with the default group settings.This module has been successfully tested against HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta running on Ubuntu 18.04."

The DeploymentFileRepository methods are only available on Jboss 4.x and 5.x."
exploit,multi/http/jboss_maindeployer,"This module can be used to execute a payload on JBoss servers that have an exposed ""jmx-console"" application. The payload is put on the server by using the jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, a temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound connections to us."
exploit,multi/http/jboss_seam_upload_exec,"Versions of the JBoss Seam 2 framework < 2.2.1CR2 fails to properly sanitize inputs to some JBoss Expression Language expressions. As a result, attackers can gain remote code execution through the application server. This module leverages RCE to upload and execute a given payload. Versions of the JBoss application server (AS) admin-console are known to be vulnerable to this exploit, without requiring authentication. Tested against JBoss AS 5 and 6, running on Linux with JDKs 6 and 7. This module provides a more efficient method of exploitation - it does not loop to find desired Java classes and methods."
exploit,multi/http/jenkins_metaprogramming,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Jenkins dynamic routing to bypass the Overall/Read ACL and leverage Groovy metaprogramming to download and execute a malicious JAR file. When the ""Java Dropper"" target is selected, the original entry point based on classLoader.parseClass is used, which requires the use of Groovy metaprogramming to achieve RCE. When the ""Unix In-Memory"" target is selected, a newer, higher-level, and more universal entry point based on GroovyShell.parse is used. This permits the use of in-memory arbitrary command execution. The ACL bypass gadget is specific to Jenkins <= 2.137 and will not work on later versions of Jenkins. Tested against Jenkins 2.137 and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.61."

exploit,multi/http/jira_hipchat_template,"Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform, but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows). HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with a vulnerable copy of HipChat. When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable. This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian."
exploit,multi/http/jira_plugin_upload,This module can be used to execute a payload on Atlassian Jira via the Universal Plugin Manager(UPM). The module requires valid login credentials to an account that has access to the plugin manager. The payload is uploaded as a JAR archive containing a servlet using a POST request against the UPM component.

exploit,multi/http/log4shell_header_injection,"Versions of Apache Log4j2 impacted by CVE-2021-44228 which allow JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters, do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. This module will exploit an HTTP end point with the Log4Shell vulnerability by injecting a format message that will trigger an LDAP connection to Metasploit and load a payload. The Automatic target delivers a Java payload using remote class loading. This requires Metasploit to run an HTTP server in addition to the LDAP server that the target can connect to. The targeted application must have the trusted code base option enabled for this technique to work. The non-Automatic targets deliver a payload via a serialized Java object. This does not require Metasploit to run an HTTP server and instead leverages the LDAP server to deliver the serialized object. The target application in this case must be compatible with the user-specified JAVA_GADGET_CHAIN option."

exploit,multi/http/manage_engine_dc_pmp_sqli,"This module exploits an unauthenticated blind SQL injection in LinkViewFetchServlet, which is exposed in ManageEngine Desktop Central v7 build 70200 to v9 build 90033 and Password Manager Pro v6 build 6500 to v7 build 7002 (including the MSP versions). The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $PATH."
exploit,multi/http/manageengine_auth_upload,"This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk, AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 when uploading attachment files. The JSP that accepts the upload does not handle correctly '../' sequences, which can be abused to write to the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, but this module will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest accounts. Alternatively, you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password. For IT360 targets, enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance (usually 8400). All versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 (including MSP but excluding v4), AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 (including MSP) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this module, only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This module has been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions."

exploit,multi/http/solr_velocity_rce,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Apache Solr <= 8.3.0 which allows remote code execution via a custom Velocity template. Currently, this module only supports Solr basic authentication. From the Tenable advisory: An attacker could target a vulnerable Apache Solr instance by first identifying a list of Solr core names. Once the core names have been identified, an attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the Config API to toggle the params resource loader value for the Velocity Response Writer in the solrconfig.xml file to true. Enabling this parameter would allow an attacker to use the Velocity template parameter in a specially crafted Solr request, leading to RCE."
exploit,multi/http/sonicwall_gms_upload,"This module exploits a code execution flaw in SonicWALL GMS. It exploits two vulnerabilities in order to get its objective. An authentication bypass in the Web Administration interface allows to abuse the ""appliance"" application and upload an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP.

Remote Code Execution can be performed via http Content-Type header. Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't have to write to the disk."
exploit,multi/http/struts2_multi_eval_ognl,"The Apache Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags attributes such as id. It is therefore possible to pass in a value to Struts that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes are rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability is application dependant. A server side template must make an affected use of request data to render an HTML tag attribute."
exploit,multi/http/struts2_namespace_ognl,"This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts version 2.3 - 2.3.4, and 2.5 - 2.5.16. Remote Code Execution can be performed via an endpoint that makes use of a redirect action. Note that this exploit is dependant on the version of Tomcat running on the target. Versions of Tomcat starting with 7.0.88 currently don't support payloads larger than ~7.5kb. Windows Meterpreter sessions on Tomcat >=7.0.88 are currently not supported. Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't have to write to the disk."
exploit,multi/http/struts2_rest_xstream,"Apache Struts versions 2.1.2 - 2.3.33 and Struts 2.5 - Struts 2.5.12, using the REST plugin, are vulnerable to a Java deserialization attack in the XStream library."
exploit,multi/http/struts_code_exec,"This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.2.0. This issue is caused by a failure to properly handle unicode characters in OGNL extensive expressions passed to the web server. By sending a specially crafted request to the Struts application it is possible to bypass the ""#"" restriction on ParameterInterceptors by using OGNL context variables. Bypassing this restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code."
exploit,multi/http/struts_code_exec_classloader,"This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions 1.x (<= 1.3.10) and 2.x (< 2.3.16.2). In Struts 1.x the problem is related with the ActionForm bean population mechanism while in case of Struts 2.x the vulnerability is due to the ParametersInterceptor. Both allow access to 'class' parameter that is directly mapped to getClass() method and allows ClassLoader manipulation. As a result, this can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via crafted parameters."
exploit,multi/http/struts_code_exec_exception_delegator,"This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.2.1.1. This issue is caused because the ExceptionDelegator interprets parameter values as OGNL expressions during certain exception handling for mismatched data types of properties, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via a crafted parameter."
exploit,multi/http/struts_code_exec_parameters,This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.3.1.2. This issue is caused because the ParametersInterceptor allows for the use of parentheses which in turn allows it to interpret parameter values as OGNL expressions during certain exception handling for mismatched data types of properties which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via a crafted parameter.
exploit,multi/http/struts_default_action_mapper,"The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with ""action:"" or ""redirect:"", followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms. In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following ""action:"", ""redirect:"" or ""redirectAction:"" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code."
exploit,multi/http/struts_dev_mode,"This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts 2. The problem exists on applications running in developer mode, where the DebuggingInterceptor allows evaluation and execution of OGNL expressions, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code.

exploit,multi/http/sun_jsws_dav_options,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in Sun Java Web Server prior to version 7 Update 8. By sending an ""OPTIONS"" request with an overly long path, attackers can execute arbitrary code. In order to reach the vulnerable code, the attacker must also specify the path to a directory with WebDAV enabled. This exploit was tested and confirmed to work on Windows XP SP3 without DEP. Versions for other platforms are vulnerable as well. The vulnerability was originally discovered and disclosed by Evgeny Legerov of Intevydis."
exploit,multi/http/sysaid_auth_file_upload,"This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk. The vulnerability exists in the ChangePhoto.jsp in the administrator portal, which does not correctly handle directory traversal sequences and does not enforce file extension restrictions. While an attacker needs an administrator account in order to leverage this vulnerability, there is a related Metasploit auxiliary module which can create this account under some circumstances. This module has been tested in SysAid v14.4 in both Linux and Windows."
exploit,multi/http/sysaid_rdslogs_file_upload,"This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk v14.3 and v14.4. The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and handles zip file contents in an insecure way. By combining both weaknesses, a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection against null byte injection in file names. This module has been tested successfully on version v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory this module also works on Windows, but SysAid seems to bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which prevents the vulnerability from being exploited."
exploit,multi/http/testlink_upload_exec,This module exploits a vulnerability in TestLink version 1.9.3 or prior. This application has an upload feature that allows any authenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the '/upload_area/nodes_hierarchy/' directory with a randomized file name. The file name can be retrieved from the database using SQL injection.
exploit,multi/http/tomcat_jsp_upload_bypass,This module uses a PUT request bypass to upload a jsp shell to a vulnerable Apache Tomcat configuration.
exploit,multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy,"This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that have an exposed ""manager"" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive containing a jsp application using a PUT request. The manager application can also be abused using /manager/html/upload, but that method is not implemented in this module. NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads."
exploit,multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload,"This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that have an exposed ""manager"" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive containing a jsp application using a POST request against the /manager/html/upload component.

exploit,multi/http/traq_plugin_exec,"This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in Traq 2.0 to 2.3. It's in the admincp/common.php script. This function is called in each script located in the /admicp/ directory to make sure the user has admin rights. This is a broken authorization schema because the header() function doesn't stop the execution flow. This can be exploited by malicious users to execute admin functionality, e.g. execution of arbitrary PHP code leveraging of plugins.php functionality."
exploit,multi/http/trendmicro_threat_discovery_admin_sys_time_cmdi,"This module exploits two vulnerabilities the Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance. The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability via a file delete in logoff.cgi which resets the admin password back to 'admin' upon a reboot (CVE-2016-7552). The second is a cmdi flaw using the timezone parameter in the admin_sys_time.cgi interface (CVE-2016-7547). Note: You have the option to use the authentication bypass or not since it requires that the server is rebooted. The password reset will render the authentication useless. Typically, if an administrator cant login, they will bounce the box. Therefore, this module performs a heartbeat request until the box is bounced and then attempts to login and to perform the command injection. This module has been tested on version 2.6.1062r1 of the appliance."
exploit,multi/http/ubiquiti_unifi_log4shell,The Ubiquiti UniFi Network Application versions 5.13.29 through 6.5.53 are affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability whereby a JNDI string can be sent to the server via the 'remember' field of a POST request to the /api/login endpoint that will cause the server to connect to the attacker and deserialize a malicious Java object. This results in OS command execution in the context of the server application. This module will start an LDAP server that the target will need to connect to.
exploit,multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1,"This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability found within the Up.Time monitoring server 7.2 and below. A malicious entity can upload a PHP file into the webroot without authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution.

exploit,multi/http/vbulletin_unserialize,This module exploits a PHP object injection vulnerability in vBulletin 5.1.2 to 5.1.9
exploit,multi/http/vbulletin_widget_template_rce,This module exploits a logic bug within the template rendering code in vBulletin 5.x. The module uses the vBulletin template rendering functionality to render the 'widget_tabbedcontainer_tab_panel' template while also providing the 'widget_php' argument. This causes the former template to load the latter bypassing filters originally put in place to address 'CVE-2019-16759'. This also allows the exploit to reach an eval call with user input allowing the module to achieve PHP remote code execution on the target. This module has been tested successfully on vBulletin version 5.6.2 on Ubuntu Linux.
exploit,multi/http/vbulletin_widgetconfig_rce,vBulletin 5.x through 5.5.4 allows remote command execution via the widgetConfig[code] parameter in an ajax/render/widget_php routestring POST request.
exploit,multi/http/visual_mining_netcharts_upload,"This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Visual Mining NetCharts. First, a lack of input validation in the administration console permits arbitrary jsp code upload to locations accessible later through the web service. Authentication is typically required, however a 'hidden' user is available by default (and non-editable). This user, named 'Scheduler', can only login to the console after any modification in the user database (a user is added, admin password is changed etc). If the 'Scheduler' user isn't available valid credentials must be supplied. The default Admin password is Admin."
exploit,multi/http/vmware_vcenter_log4shell,VMware vCenter Server is affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability whereby a JNDI string can sent to the server that will cause it to connect to the attacker and deserialize a malicious Java object. This results in OS command execution in the context of the root user in the case of the Linux virtual appliance and SYSTEM on Windows. This module will start an LDAP server that the target will need to connect to. This exploit uses the logon page vector.
exploit,multi/http/vmware_vcenter_uploadova_rce,"This module exploits an unauthenticated OVA file upload and path traversal in VMware vCenter Server to write a JSP payload to a web-accessible directory. Fixed versions are 6.5 Update 3n, 6.7 Update 3l, and 7.0 Update 1c. Note that later vulnerable versions of the Linux appliance aren't exploitable via the webshell technique. Furthermore, writing an SSH public key to /home/vsphere-ui/.ssh/authorized_keys works, but the user's non-existent password expires 90 days after install, rendering the technique nearly useless against production environments. You'll have the best luck targeting older versions of the Linux appliance. The Windows target should work ubiquitously."
exploit,multi/http/vtiger_install_rce,"This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the Vtiger install script. This module is set to ManualRanking due to this module overwriting the target database configuration, which may result in a broken web app, and you may not be able to get a session again."

exploit,multi/http/wp_popular_posts_rce,"This exploit requires Metasploit to have a FQDN and the ability to run a payload web server on port 80, 443, or 8080. The FQDN must also not resolve to a reserved address (192/172/127/10). The server must also respond to a HEAD request for the payload, prior to getting a GET request. This exploit leverages an authenticated improper input validation in Wordpress plugin Popular Posts <= 5.3.2. The exploit chain is rather complicated. Authentication is required and 'gd' for PHP is required on the server. Then the Popular Post plugin is reconfigured to allow for an arbitrary URL for the post image in the widget. A post is made, then requests are sent to the post to make it more popular than the previous #1 by 5. Once the post hits the top 5, and after a 60sec (we wait 90) server cache refresh, the homepage widget is loaded which triggers the plugin to download the payload from our server. Our payload has a 'GIF' header, and a double extension ('.gif.php') allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed."

This module has been tested successfully on Novell ZENworks Configuration Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2 on Windows 2003 SP2 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3."
exploit,multi/http/zpanel_information_disclosure_rce,This module exploits an information disclosure vulnerability in ZPanel. The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable version of pChart used by ZPanel that allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files remotely on the file system. This particular module utilizes this vulnerability to identify the username/password combination of the MySQL instance. With the credentials the attackers can login to PHPMyAdmin and execute SQL commands to drop a malicious payload on the filesystem and call it leading to remote code execution.
exploit,multi/ids/snort_dce_rpc,"This module allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the Snort service via crafted SMB traffic. The vulnerability is due to a boundary error within the DCE/RPC preprocessor when reassembling SMB Write AndX requests, which may result a stack-based buffer overflow with a specially crafted packet sent on a network that is monitored by Snort. Vulnerable versions include Snort 2.6.1, 2.7 Beta 1 and SourceFire IDS 4.1, 4.5 and 4.6. Any host on the Snort network may be used as the remote host. The remote host does not need to be running the SMB service for the exploit to be successful."

exploit,multi/local/magnicomp_sysinfo_mcsiwrapper_priv_esc,"This module attempts to gain root privileges on systems running MagniComp SysInfo versions prior to 10-H64. The .mcsiwrapper suid executable allows loading a config file using the '--configfile' argument. The 'ExecPath' config directive is used to set the executable load path. This module abuses this functionality to set the load path resulting in execution of arbitrary code as root. This module has been tested successfully with SysInfo version 10-H63 on Fedora 20 x86_64, 10-H32 on Fedora 27 x86_64, 10-H10 on Debian 8 x86_64, and 10-GA on Solaris 10u11 x86."
exploit,multi/local/xorg_x11_suid_server,"This module attempts to gain root privileges with SUID Xorg X11 server versions 1.19.0 < 1.20.3. A permission check flaw exists for -modulepath and -logfile options when starting Xorg. This allows unprivileged users that can start the server the ability to elevate privileges and run arbitrary code under root privileges. This module has been tested with OpenBSD 6.3, 6.4, CentOS 7.4.1708, and CentOS 7.5.1804, and RHEL 7.5. The default PAM configuration for CentOS and RHEL systems requires console auth for the user's session to start the Xorg server. Cron launches the payload, so if SELinux is enforcing, exploitation may still be possible, but the module will bail. Xorg must have SUID permissions and may not start if already running. On exploitation a crontab.old backup file will be created by Xorg. This module will remove the .old file and restore crontab after successful exploitation. Failed exploitation may result in a corrupted crontab. On successful exploitation artifacts will be created consistant with starting Xorg and running a cron."
exploit,multi/local/xorg_x11_suid_server_modulepath,This module attempts to gain root privileges with SUID Xorg X11 server versions 1.19.0 < 1.20.3.

The vulnerability exists in the Backup client service, which listens by default on TCP/5555. The EXEC_INTEGUTIL request allows to execute arbitrary commands from a restricted directory. Since it includes a perl executable, it's possible to use an EXEC_INTEGUTIL packet to execute arbitrary code. On linux targets, the perl binary isn't on the restricted directory, but an EXEC_BAR packet can be used to access the perl binary, even in the last version of HP Data Protector for linux. This module has been tested successfully on HP Data Protector 9 over Windows 2008 R2 64 bits and CentOS 6 64 bits."
exploit,multi/misc/hp_vsa_exec,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in HP's StorageWorks P4000 VSA on versions prior to 9.5. By using a default account credential, it is possible to inject arbitrary commands as part of a ping request via port 13838."
exploit,multi/misc/ibm_tm1_unauth_rce,"This module exploits a vulnerability in IBM TM1 / Planning Analytics that allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform a configuration overwrite. It starts by querying the Admin server for the available applications, picks one, and then exploits it. You can also provide an application name to bypass this step, and exploit the application directly. The configuration overwrite is used to change an application server authentication method to ""CAM"", a proprietary IBM auth method, which is simulated by the exploit. The exploit then performs a fake authentication as admin, and finally abuses TM1 scripting to perform a command injection as root or SYSTEM. Testing was done on IBM PA 2.0.6 and IBM TM1 10.2.2 on Windows and Linux. Versions up to and including PA 2.0.8 are vulnerable. It is likely that versions earlier than TM1 10.2.2 are also vulnerable (10.2.2 was released in 2014)."

JMX interfaces with authentication disabled (com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false) should be vulnerable, while interfaces with authentication enabled will be vulnerable only if a weak configuration is deployed (allowing to use javax.management.loading.MLet, having a security manager allowing to load a ClassLoader MBean, etc.)."
exploit,multi/misc/java_rmi_server,"This module takes advantage of the default configuration of the RMI Registry and RMI Activation services, which allow loading classes from any remote (HTTP) URL. As it invokes a method in the RMI Distributed Garbage Collector which is available via every RMI endpoint, it can be used against both rmiregistry and rmid, and against most other (custom) RMI endpoints as well. Note that it does not work against Java Management Extension (JMX) ports since those do not support remote class loading, unless another RMI endpoint is active in the same Java process. RMI method calls do not support or require any sort of authentication."

The Java Bridge is responsible for handling interactions between PHP and Java code within Zend Server. When Java code is encountered Zend Server communicates with the Java Bridge. The Java Bridge then handles the java code and creates the objects within the Java Virtual Machine. This interaction however, does not require any sort of authentication. This leaves the JVM wide open to remote attackers. Sending specially crafted data to the Java Bridge results in the execution of arbitrary java code."

exploit,multi/php/php_unserialize_zval_cookie,"This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the unserialize() function of the PHP web server extension. This vulnerability was patched by Stefan in version 4.5.0 and applies all previous versions supporting this function. This particular module targets numerous web applications and is based on the proof of concept provided by Stefan Esser. This vulnerability requires approximately 900k of data to trigger due the multiple Cookie headers requirement. Since we are already assuming a fast network connection, we use a 2Mb block of shellcode for the brute force, allowing quick exploitation for those with fast networks. One of the neat things about this vulnerability is that on x86 systems, the EDI register points into the beginning of the hashtable string. This can be used with an egghunter to quickly exploit systems where the location of a valid ""jmp EDI"" or ""call EDI"" instruction is known. The EDI method is faster, but the bandwidth-intensive brute force used by this module is more reliable across a wider range of systems."

The vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Miami 2020 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski)."
exploit,multi/script/web_delivery,"This module quickly fires up a web server that serves a payload. The module will provide a command to be run on the target machine based on the selected target. The provided command will download and execute a payload using either a specified scripting language interpreter or ""squiblydoo"" via regsvr32.exe for bypassing application whitelisting. The main purpose of this module is to quickly establish a session on a target machine when the attacker has to manually type in the command: e.g. Command Injection, RDP Session, Local Access or maybe Remote Command Execution. This attack vector does not write to disk so it is less likely to trigger AV solutions and will allow privilege escalations supplied by Meterpreter. When using either of the PSH targets, ensure the payload architecture matches the target computer or use SYSWOW64 powershell.exe to execute x86 payloads on x64 machines. Regsvr32 uses ""squiblydoo"" technique to bypass application whitelisting. The signed Microsoft binary file, Regsvr32, is able to request an .sct file and then execute the included PowerShell command inside of it. Similarly, the pubprn target uses the pubprn.vbs script to request and execute a .sct file. Both web requests (i.e., the .sct file and PowerShell download/execute) can occur on the same port. The SyncAppvPublishingServer target uses SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe Microsoft signed binary to request and execute a PowerShell script. This technique only works on Windows 10 builds <= 1709. ""PSH (Binary)"" will write a file to the disk, allowing for custom binaries to be served up to be downloaded and executed."

The target will then download the payload wrapped in an executable from the FTP service."
exploit,netware/smb/lsass_cifs,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetWare CIFS.NLM driver. Since the driver runs in the kernel space, a failed exploit attempt can cause the OS to reboot."
exploit,netware/sunrpc/pkernel_callit,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the NetWare PKERNEL.NLM driver's CALLIT procedure. PKERNEL.NLM is installed by default on all NetWare servers to support NFS. The PKERNEL.NLM module runs in kernel mode so a failed exploit attempt can cause the operating system to reboot.
exploit,openbsd/local/dynamic_loader_chpass_privesc,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the OpenBSD `ld.so` dynamic loader (CVE-2019-19726). The `_dl_getenv()` function fails to reset the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable when set with approximately `ARG_MAX` colons. This can be abused to load `libutil.so` from an untrusted path, using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in combination with the `chpass` set-uid executable, resulting in privileged code execution. This module has been tested successfully on: OpenBSD 6.1 (amd64); and OpenBSD 6.6 (amd64)"
exploit,osx/afp/loginext,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the AppleFileServer service on MacOS X. This vulnerability was originally reported by Atstake and was actually one of the few useful advisories ever published by that company. You only have one chance to exploit this bug. This particular exploit uses a stack-based return address that will only work under optimal conditions.
exploit,osx/arkeia/type77,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Arkeia backup client for the Mac OS X platform. This vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 5.3.3 and has been tested with Arkeia 5.3.1 on Mac OS X 10.3.5.
exploit,osx/browser/adobe_flash_delete_range_tl_op,"This module exploits a type confusion on Adobe Flash Player, which was originally found being successfully exploited in the wild. This module has been tested successfully on: macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Safari and Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.182, Firefox and Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.182."
exploit,osx/browser/mozilla_mchannel,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.16. An OBJECT element, mChannel, can be freed via the OnChannelRedirect method of the nsIChannelEventSink Interface. mChannel becomes a dangling pointer and can be reused when setting the OBJECTs data attribute. This module has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.6, 10.6.7, 10.6.8, 10.7.2 and 10.7.3."
exploit,osx/browser/osx_gatekeeper_bypass,"This module exploits two CVEs that bypass Gatekeeper. For CVE-2021-30657, this module serves an OSX app (as a zip) that contains no Info.plist, which bypasses gatekeeper in macOS < 11.3. If the user visits the site on Safari, the zip file is automatically extracted, and clicking on the downloaded file will automatically launch the payload. If the user visits the site in another browser, the user must click once to unzip the app, and click again in order to execute the payload. For CVE-2022-22616, this module serves a gzip-compressed zip file with its file header pointing to the `Contents` directory which contains an OSX app. If the user downloads the file via Safari, Safari will automatically decompress the file, removing its `com.apple.quarantine` attribute. Because of this, the file will not require quarantining, bypassing Gatekeeper on MacOS versions below 12.3."
exploit,osx/browser/safari_file_policy,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple Safari on OS X platform. A policy issue in the handling of file:// URLs may allow arbitrary remote code execution under the context of the user. In order to trigger arbitrary remote code execution, the best way seems to be opening a share on the victim machine first (this can be SMB/WebDav/FTP, or a file format that OS X might automount), and then execute it in /Volumes/[share]. If there's some kind of bug that leaks the victim machine's current username, then it's also possible to execute the payload in /Users/[username]/Downloads/, or else bruteforce your way to getting that information. Please note that non-java payloads (*.sh extension) might get launched by Xcode instead of executing it, in that case please try the Java ones instead."
exploit,osx/browser/safari_in_operator_side_effect,"This module exploits an incorrect side-effect modeling of the 'in' operator. The DFG compiler assumes that the 'in' operator is side-effect free, however the <embed> element with the PDF plugin provides a callback that can trigger side-effects leading to type confusion (CVE-2020-9850). The type confusion can be used as addrof and fakeobj primitives that then lead to arbitrary read/write of memory. These primitives allow us to write shellcode into a JIT region (RWX memory) containing the next stage of the exploit. The next stage uses CVE-2020-9856 to exploit a heap overflow in CVM Server, and extracts a macOS application containing our payload into /var/db/CVMS. The payload can then be opened with CVE-2020-9801, executing the payload as a user but without sandbox restrictions."
exploit,osx/browser/safari_metadata_archive,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Safari's ""Safe file"" feature, which will automatically open any file with one of the allowed extensions. This can be abused by supplying a zip file, containing a shell script, with a metafile indicating that the file should be opened by Terminal.app. This module depends on the 'zip' command-line utility."
exploit,osx/browser/safari_proxy_object_type_confusion,"This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The JIT region is then replaced with shellcode which loads the second stage. The second stage exploits a logic error in libxpc, which uses command execution via the launchd's ""spawn_via_launchd"" API (CVE-2018-4404)."
exploit,osx/browser/safari_user_assisted_applescript_exec,"In versions of Mac OS X before 10.11.1, the applescript:// URL scheme is provided, which opens the provided script in the Applescript Editor. Pressing cmd-R in the Editor executes the code without any additional confirmation from the user. By getting the user to press cmd-R in Safari, and by hooking the cmd-key keypress event, a user can be tricked into running arbitrary Applescript code. Gatekeeper should be disabled from Security & Privacy in order to avoid the unidentified Developer prompt."
exploit,osx/browser/safari_user_assisted_download_launch,"This module abuses some Safari functionality to force the download of a zipped .app OSX application containing our payload. The app is then invoked using a custom URL scheme. At this point, the user is presented with Gatekeeper's prompt: ""APP_NAME"" is an application downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it? If the user clicks ""Open"", the app and its payload are executed. If the user has the ""Only allow applications downloaded from Mac App Store and identified developers (on by default on OS 10.8+), the user will see an error dialog containing ""can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."" To work around this issue, you will need to manually build and sign an OSX app containing your payload with a custom URL handler called ""openurl"". You can put newlines and unicode in your APP_NAME, although you must be careful not to create a prompt that is too tall, or the user will not be able to click the buttons, and will have to either logout or kill the CoreServicesUIAgent process."
exploit,osx/browser/software_update,"This module exploits a feature in the Distribution Packages, which are used in the Apple Software Update mechanism. This feature allows for arbitrary command execution through JavaScript. This exploit provides the malicious update server. Requests must be redirected to this server by other means for this exploit to work."
exploit,osx/email/mailapp_image_exec,"This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in the Mail.app application shipped with Mac OS X 10.5.0. This flaw was patched in 10.4 in March of 2007, but reintroduced into the final release of 10.5."
exploit,osx/ftp/webstar_ftp_user,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the logging routine of the WebSTAR FTP server. Reliable code execution is obtained by a series of hops through the System library.
exploit,osx/http/evocam_webserver,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the web server provided with the EvoCam program for Mac OS X. We use Dino Dai Zovi's exec-from-heap technique to copy the payload from the non-executable stack segment to heap memory. Vulnerable versions include 3.6.6, 3.6.7, and possibly earlier versions as well. EvoCam version 3.6.8 fixes the vulnerability."
exploit,osx/local/cfprefsd_race_condition,"This module exploits an arbitrary file write in cfprefsd on macOS <= 10.15.4 in order to run a payload as root. The CFPreferencesSetAppValue function, which is reachable from most unsandboxed processes, can be exploited with a race condition in order to overwrite an arbitrary file as root. By overwriting /etc/pam.d/login a user can then login as root with the `login root` command without a password."
exploit,osx/local/dyld_print_to_file_root,"In Apple OS X 10.10.4 and prior, the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE environment variable is used for redirecting logging data to a file instead of stderr. Due to a design error, this feature can be abused by a local attacker to write arbitrary files as root via restricted, SUID-root binaries."
exploit,osx/local/feedback_assistant_root,This module exploits a race condition vulnerability in Mac's Feedback Assistant. A successful attempt would result in remote code execution under the context of root.
exploit,osx/local/iokit_keyboard_root,"A heap overflow in IOHIKeyboardMapper::parseKeyMapping allows kernel memory corruption in Mac OS X before 10.10. By abusing a bug in the IORegistry, kernel pointers can also be leaked, allowing a full kASLR bypass. Tested on Mavericks 10.9.5, and should work on previous versions. The issue was patched silently in Yosemite."
exploit,osx/local/libxpc_mitm_ssudo,"This module exploits a vulnerablity in libxpc on macOS <= 10.13.3 The task_set_special_port API allows callers to overwrite their bootstrap port, which is used to communicate with launchd. This port is inherited across forks: child processes will use the same bootstrap port as the parent. By overwriting the bootstrap port and forking a child processes, we can now gain a MitM position between our child and launchd. To gain root we target the sudo binary and intercept its communication with opendirectoryd, which is used by sudo to verify credentials. We modify the replies from opendirectoryd to make it look like our password was valid."
exploit,osx/local/nfs_mount_root,"This exploit leverages a stack buffer overflow vulnerability to escalate privileges. The vulnerable function nfs_convert_old_nfs_args does not verify the size of a user-provided argument before copying it to the stack. As a result, by passing a large size as an argument, a local user can overwrite the stack with arbitrary content. Mac OS X Lion Kernel <= xnu-1699.32.7 except xnu-1699.24.8 are affected."
exploit,osx/local/persistence,"This module provides a persistent boot payload by creating a plist entry in current user's ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory. Whenever the user logs in, the LaunchAgent will be invoked and this dropped payload will run."
exploit,osx/local/root_no_password,"This module exploits a serious flaw in MacOSX High Sierra. Any user can login with user ""root"", leaving an empty password."
exploit,osx/local/rootpipe,"This module exploits a hidden backdoor API in Apple's Admin framework on Mac OS X to escalate privileges to root, dubbed ""Rootpipe."" This module was tested on Yosemite 10.10.2 and should work on previous versions. The patch for this issue was not backported to older releases. Note: you must run this exploit as an admin user to escalate to root."
exploit,osx/local/rootpipe_entitlements,This module exploits the rootpipe vulnerability and bypasses Apple's initial fix for the issue by injecting code into a process with the 'admin.writeconfig' entitlement.
exploit,osx/local/rsh_libmalloc,"This module writes to the sudoers file without root access by exploiting rsh and malloc log files. Makes sudo require no password, giving access to su even if root is disabled. Works on OS X 10.9.5 to 10.10.5 (patched on 10.11)."
exploit,osx/local/setuid_tunnelblick,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Tunnelblick 3.2.8 on Mac OS X. The vulnerability exists in the setuid openvpnstart, where an insufficient validation of path names allows execution of arbitrary shell scripts as root. This module has been tested successfully on Tunnelblick 3.2.8 build 2891.3099 over Mac OS X 10.7.5."
exploit,osx/local/setuid_viscosity,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Viscosity 1.4.1 on Mac OS X. The vulnerability exists in the setuid ViscosityHelper, where an insufficient validation of path names allows execution of arbitrary python code as root. This module has been tested successfully on Viscosity 1.4.1 over Mac OS X 10.7.5."
exploit,osx/local/sudo_password_bypass,"This module gains a session with root permissions on versions of OS X with sudo binary vulnerable to CVE-2013-1775. Tested working on Mac OS 10.7-10.8.4, and possibly lower versions. If your session belongs to a user with Administrative Privileges (the user is in the sudoers file and is in the ""admin group""), and the user has ever run the ""sudo"" command, it is possible to become the super user by running `sudo -k` and then resetting the system clock to 01-01-1970. This module will fail silently if the user is not an admin, if the user has never run the sudo command, or if the admin has locked the Date/Time preferences. Note: If the user has locked the Date/Time preferences, requests to overwrite the system clock will be ignored, and the module will silently fail. However, if the ""Require an administrator password to access locked preferences"" setting is not enabled, the Date/Time preferences are often unlocked every time the admin logs in, so you can install persistence and wait for a chance later."
exploit,osx/local/timemachine_cmd_injection,"This module exploits a command injection in TimeMachine on macOS <= 10.14.3 in order to run a payload as root. The tmdiagnose binary on OSX <= 10.14.3 suffers from a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by creating a specially crafted disk label. The tmdiagnose binary uses awk to list every mounted volume, and composes shell commands based on the volume labels. By creating a volume label with the backtick character, we can have our own binary executed with root priviledges."
exploit,osx/local/tpwn,This module exploits a null pointer dereference in XNU to escalate privileges to root. Tested on 10.10.4 and 10.10.5.
exploit,osx/local/vmware_bash_function_root,"This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets the VMWare Fusion application, allowing an unprivileged local user to get root access."
exploit,osx/local/vmware_fusion_lpe,"This exploits an improper use of setuid binaries within VMware Fusion 10.1.3 - 11.5.3. The Open VMware USB Arbitrator Service can be launched outide of its standard path which allows loading of an attacker controlled binary. By creating a payload in the user home directory in a specific folder, and creating a hard link to the 'Open VMware USB Arbitrator Service' binary, we're able to launch it temporarily to start our payload with an effective UID of 0. @jeffball55 discovered an incomplete patch in 11.5.3 with a TOCTOU race. Successfully tested against 10.1.6, 11.5.1, 11.5.2, and 11.5.3."
exploit,osx/mdns/upnp_location,This module exploits a buffer overflow that occurs when processing specially crafted requests set to mDNSResponder. All Mac OS X systems between version 10.4 and 10.4.9 (without the 2007-005 patch) are affected.

exploit,osx/rtsp/quicktime_rtsp_content_type,"This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime before version 7.3.1. By sending an overly long RTSP response to a client, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code."
exploit,osx/samba/lsa_transnames_heap,This module triggers a heap overflow in the LSA RPC service of the Samba daemon. This module uses the szone_free() to overwrite the size() or free() pointer in initial_malloc_zones structure.
exploit,osx/samba/trans2open,This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the bug on Mac OS X PowerPC systems.
exploit,qnx/local/ifwatchd_priv_esc,"This module attempts to gain root privileges on QNX 6.4.x and 6.5.x systems by exploiting the ifwatchd suid executable. ifwatchd allows users to specify scripts to execute using the '-A' command line argument; however, it does not drop privileges when executing user-supplied scripts, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands as root. This module has been tested successfully on QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 (x86) and 6.5.0 SP1 (x86)."
exploit,qnx/qconn/qconn_exec,This module uses the qconn daemon on QNX systems to gain a shell. The QNX qconn daemon does not require authentication and allows remote users to execute arbitrary operating system commands. This module has been tested successfully on QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 (x86) and 6.5.0 SP1 (x86).
exploit,solaris/dtspcd/heap_noir,This is a port of noir's dtspcd exploit. This module should work against any vulnerable version of Solaris 8 (sparc). The original exploit code was published in the book Shellcoder's Handbook.
exploit,solaris/local/extremeparr_dtappgather_priv_esc,"This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the `dtappgather` executable included with Common Desktop Environment (CDE) on unpatched Solaris systems prior to Solaris 10u11 which allows users to gain root privileges. dtappgather allows users to create a user-owned directory at any location on the filesystem using the `DTUSERSESSION` environment variable. This module creates a directory in `/usr/lib/locale`, writes a shared object to the directory, and runs the specified SUID binary with the shared object loaded using the `LC_TIME` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully on: Solaris 9u7 (09/04) (x86); Solaris 10u1 (01/06) (x86); Solaris 10u2 (06/06) (x86); Solaris 10u4 (08/07) (x86); Solaris 10u8 (10/09) (x86); Solaris 10u9 (09/10) (x86)."
exploit,solaris/local/libnspr_nspr_log_file_priv_esc,"This module exploits an arbitrary file write vulnerability in the Netscape Portable Runtime library (libnspr) on unpatched Solaris systems prior to Solaris 10u3 which allows users to gain root privileges. libnspr versions prior to 4.6.3 allow users to specify a log file with the `NSPR_LOG_FILE` environment variable. The log file is created with the privileges of the running process, resulting in privilege escalation when used in combination with a SUID executable. This module writes a shared object to the trusted library directory `/usr/lib/secure` and runs the specified SUID binary with the shared object loaded using the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully with libnspr version 4.5.1 on Solaris 10u1 (01/06) (x86) and Solaris 10u2 (06/06) (x86)."
exploit,solaris/local/rsh_stack_clash_priv_esc,"This module exploits a vulnerability in RSH on unpatched Solaris systems which allows users to gain root privileges. The stack guard page on unpatched Solaris systems is of insufficient size to prevent collisions between the stack and heap memory, aka Stack Clash. This module uploads and executes Qualys' Solaris_rsh.c exploit, which exploits a vulnerability in RSH to bypass the stack guard page to write to the stack and create a SUID root shell. This module has offsets for Solaris versions 11.1 (x86) and Solaris 11.3 (x86). Exploitation will usually complete within a few minutes using the default number of worker threads (10). Occasionally, exploitation will fail. If the target system is vulnerable, usually re-running the exploit will be successful. This module has been tested successfully on Solaris 11.1 (x86) and Solaris 11.3 (x86)."
exploit,solaris/local/xscreensaver_log_priv_esc,"This module exploits a vulnerability in `xscreensaver` versions since 5.06 on unpatched Solaris 11 systems which allows users to gain root privileges. `xscreensaver` allows users to create a user-owned file at any location on the filesystem using the `-log` command line argument introduced in version 5.06. This module uses `xscreensaver` to create a log file in `/usr/lib/secure/`, overwrites the log file with a shared object, and executes the shared object using the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully on: xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.1 (x86); and xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.3 (x86)."

exploit,solaris/sunrpc/sadmind_adm_build_path,"This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in adm_build_path() function of sadmind daemon. The distributed system administration daemon (sadmind) is the daemon used by Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed system administration operations. The sadmind daemon is started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a request to invoke an operation is received. The sadmind daemon process continues to run for 15 minutes after the last request is completed, unless a different idle-time is specified with the -i command line option. The sadmind daemon may be started independently from the command line, for example, at system boot time. In this case, the -i option has no effect; sadmind continues to run, even if there are no active requests."
exploit,solaris/sunrpc/sadmind_exec,"This exploit targets a weakness in the default security settings of the sadmind RPC application. This server is installed and enabled by default on most versions of the Solaris operating system. Vulnerable systems include solaris 2.7, 8, and 9"
exploit,solaris/sunrpc/ypupdated_exec,"This exploit targets a weakness in the way the ypupdated RPC application uses the command shell when handling a MAP UPDATE request. Extra commands may be launched through this command shell, which runs as root on the remote host, by passing commands in the format '|<command>'.

exploit,solaris/telnet/fuser,This module exploits the argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) of Solaris 10 and 11.
exploit,solaris/telnet/ttyprompt,This module uses a buffer overflow in the Solaris 'login' application to bypass authentication in the telnet daemon.
exploit,unix/dhcp/bash_environment,"This module exploits the Shellshock vulnerability, a flaw in how the Bash shell handles external environment variables. This module targets dhclient by responding to DHCP requests with a malicious hostname, domainname, and URL which are then passed to the configuration scripts as environment variables, resulting in code execution. Due to length restrictions and the unusual networking scenario at the time of exploitation, this module achieves code execution by writing the payload into /etc/crontab and then cleaning it up after a session is created."
exploit,unix/dhcp/rhel_dhcp_client_command_injection,"This module exploits the DynoRoot vulnerability, a flaw in how the NetworkManager integration script included in the DHCP client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, Fedora 28, and earlier processes DHCP options. A malicious DHCP server, or an attacker on the local network able to spoof DHCP responses, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on systems using NetworkManager and configured to obtain network configuration using the DHCP protocol."
exploit,unix/fileformat/exiftool_djvu_ant_perl_injection,This module exploits a Perl injection vulnerability in the DjVu ANT parsing code of ExifTool versions 7.44 through 12.23 inclusive.

This vulnerability affects Ghostscript versions 9.21 and earlier and can be exploited through libraries such as ImageMagick and Pillow.
exploit,unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate,"This module exploits a shell command injection in the way ""delegates"" (commands for converting files) are processed in ImageMagick versions <= 7.0.1-0 and <= 6.9.3-9 (legacy). Since ImageMagick uses file magic to detect file format, you can create a .png (for example) which is actually a crafted SVG (for example) that triggers the command injection. The PostScript (PS) target leverages a Ghostscript -dSAFER bypass (discovered by taviso) to achieve RCE in the Ghostscript delegate. Ghostscript versions 9.18 and later are affected. This target is provided as is and will not be updated to track additional vulns. If USE_POPEN is set to true, a |-prefixed command will be used for the exploit. No delegates are involved in this exploitation."
exploit,unix/fileformat/metasploit_libnotify_cmd_injection,This module exploits a shell command injection vulnerability in the libnotify plugin. This vulnerability affects Metasploit versions 5.0.79 and earlier.
exploit,unix/fileformat/metasploit_msfvenom_apk_template_cmd_injection,"This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Metasploit Framework's msfvenom payload generator when using a crafted APK file as an Android payload template. Affects Metasploit Framework <= 6.0.11 and Metasploit Pro <= 4.18.0. The file produced by this module is a relatively empty yet valid-enough APK file.

exploit,unix/http/laravel_token_unserialize_exec,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the PHP Laravel Framework for versions 5.5.40, 5.6.x <= 5.6.29. Remote Command Execution is possible via a correctly formatted HTTP X-XSRF-TOKEN header, due to an insecure unserialize call of the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php. Authentication is not required, however exploitation requires knowledge of the Laravel APP_KEY. Similar vulnerabilities appear to exist within Laravel cookie tokens based on the code fix. In some cases the APP_KEY is leaked which allows for discovery and exploitation."
exploit,unix/http/lifesize_room,This module exploits a vulnerable resource in LifeSize Room versions 3.5.3 and 4.7.18 to inject OS commands. LifeSize Room is an appliance and thus the environment is limited resulting in a small set of payload options.
exploit,unix/http/pfsense_clickjacking,"This module exploits a Clickjacking vulnerability in pfSense <= 2.4.1. pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router. It was found that the pfSense WebGUI is vulnerable to Clickjacking. By tricking an authenticated admin into interacting with a specially crafted webpage it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the WebGUI. Since the WebGUI runs as the root user, this will result in a full compromise of the pfSense instance."
exploit,unix/http/pfsense_diag_routes_webshell,"This module exploits an arbitrary file creation vulnerability in the pfSense HTTP interface (CVE-2021-41282). The vulnerability affects versions <= 2.5.2 and can be exploited by an authenticated user if they have the ""WebCfg - Diagnostics: Routing tables"" privilege.

exploit,unix/http/pihole_blocklist_exec,"This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.4. A new blocklist is added, and then an update is forced (gravity) to pull in the blocklist content. PHP content is then written to a file within the webroot. Phase 1 writes a sudo pihole command to launch teleporter, effectively running a priv esc. Phase 2 writes our payload to teleporter.php, overwriting, the content. Lastly, the phase 1 PHP file is called in the web root, which launches our payload in teleporter.php with root privileges."
exploit,unix/http/pihole_dhcp_mac_exec,This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.3.2. A new DHCP static lease is added with a MAC address which includes an RCE. Exploitation requires /opt/pihole to be first in the $PATH due to exploitation constraints. DHCP server is not required to be running.

exploit,unix/local/opensmtpd_oob_read_lpe,"This module exploits an out-of-bounds read of an attacker-controlled string in OpenSMTPD's MTA implementation to execute a command as the root or nobody user, depending on the kind of grammar OpenSMTPD uses."
exploit,unix/local/setuid_nmap,"Nmap's man page mentions that ""Nmap should never be installed with special privileges (e.g. suid root) for security reasons.."" and specifically avoids making any of its binaries setuid during installation. Nevertheless, administrators sometimes feel the need to do insecure things. This module abuses a setuid nmap binary by writing out a lua nse script containing a call to os.execute(). Note that modern interpreters will refuse to run scripts on the command line when EUID != UID, so the cmd/unix/reverse_{perl,ruby} payloads will most likely not work."
exploit,unix/misc/distcc_exec,This module uses a documented security weakness to execute arbitrary commands on any system running distccd.
exploit,unix/misc/polycom_hdx_auth_bypass,"The login component of the Polycom Command Shell on Polycom HDX video endpoints, running software versions 3.0.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to an authorization bypass when simultaneous connections are made to the service, allowing remote network attackers to gain access to a sandboxed telnet prompt without authentication. Versions prior to 3.0.4 contain OS command injection in the ping command which can be used to execute arbitrary commands as root."

When implemented with black hole mode enabled, it is possible to execute commands remotely due to an insecure popen call."
exploit,unix/smtp/exim4_string_format,"This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root."
exploit,unix/smtp/morris_sendmail_debug,"This module exploits sendmail's well-known historical debug mode to escape to a shell and execute commands in the SMTP RCPT TO command. This vulnerability was exploited by the Morris worm in 1988-11-02. Cliff Stoll reports on the worm in the epilogue of The Cuckoo's Egg. Currently, only cmd/unix/reverse and cmd/unix/generic are supported."
exploit,unix/smtp/opensmtpd_mail_from_rce,This module exploits a command injection in the MAIL FROM field during SMTP interaction with OpenSMTPD to execute a command as the root user.
exploit,unix/smtp/qmail_bash_env_exec,"This module exploits a shellshock vulnerability on Qmail, a public domain MTA written in C that runs on Unix systems. Due to the lack of validation on the MAIL FROM field, it is possible to execute shell code on a system with a vulnerable BASH (Shellshock). This flaw works on the latest Qmail versions (qmail-1.03 and netqmail-1.06). However, in order to execute code, /bin/sh has to be linked to bash (usually default configuration) and a valid recipient must be set on the RCPT TO field (usually admin@exampledomain.com). The exploit does not work on the ""qmailrocks"" community version as it ensures the MAILFROM field is well-formed."
exploit,unix/sonicwall/sonicwall_xmlrpc_rce,"This module exploits a vulnerability in SonicWall Global Management System Virtual Appliance versions 8.1 (Build 8110.1197) and below. This virtual appliance can be downloaded from http://www.sonicwall.com/products/sonicwall-gms/ and is used 'in a holistic way to manage your entire network security environment.' These vulnerable versions (8.1 Build 8110.1197 and below) do not prevent unauthenticated, external entities from making XML-RPC requests to port 21009 of the virtual app. After the XML-RPC call is made, a shell script is called like so: 'timeSetup.sh --tz=""`command injection here`""' --usentp=""blah""'."

exploit,unix/webapp/aerohive_netconfig_lfi_log_poison_rce,"This module exploits LFI and log poisoning vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-16152) in Aerohive NetConfig, version 10.0r8a build-242466 and older in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application will hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. Closing the session should render the app responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a."

exploit,unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce,"This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS version 3.7.0 and 3.6.* in order to execute arbitrary commands as the user running Bolt. This module first takes advantage of a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to change the username in /bolt/profile to a PHP `system($_GET[""""])` variable. Next, the module obtains a list of tokens from `/async/browse/cache/.sessions` and uses these to create files with the blacklisted `.php` extention via HTTP POST requests to `/async/folder/rename`. For each created file, the module checks the HTTP response for evidence that the file can be used to execute arbitrary commands via the created PHP $_GET variable. If the response is negative, the file is deleted, otherwise the payload is executed via an HTTP get request in this format: `/files/<rogue_PHP_file>?<$_GET_var>=<payload>` Valid credentials for a Bolt CMS user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Bolt CMS 3.7.0 running on CentOS 7."

A wp-nonce (CSRF token) is created on the backend index page and the same token is used on handling ajax file uploads through the plugin. By sending the captured nonce with the upload, we can upload arbitrary files to the upload folder. Because the plugin also uses its own file upload mechanism instead of the WordPress api it's possible to upload any file type. The user provided does not need special rights, and users with ""Contributor"" role can be abused."
exploit,unix/webapp/wp_wysija_newsletters_upload,"The Wordpress plugin ""MailPoet Newsletters"" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too."

exploit,windows/backupexec/name_service,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the Veritas Backup Exec Agent Browser service. This vulnerability occurs when a recv() call has a length value too long for the destination stack buffer. By sending an agent name value of 63 bytes or more, we can overwrite the return address of the recv function. Since we only have ~60 bytes of contiguous space for shellcode, a tiny findsock payload is sent which uses a hardcoded IAT address for the recv() function. This payload will then roll the stack back to the beginning of the page, recv() the real shellcode into it, and jump to it. This module has been tested against Veritas 9.1 SP0, 9.1 SP1, and 8.6."
exploit,windows/backupexec/remote_agent,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Veritas BackupExec Windows Agent software. This vulnerability occurs when a client authentication request is received with type '3' and a long password argument.

exploit,windows/backupexec/ssl_uaf,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of SSL NDMP connections in Veritas/Symantec Backup Exec's Remote Agent for Windows. When SSL is re-established on a NDMP connection that previously has had SSL established, the BIO struct for the connection's previous SSL session is reused, even though it has previously been freed. This module supports 3 specific versions of the Backup Exec agent in the 14, 15 and 16 series on 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows and has been tested from Vista to Windows 10. The check command can help narrow down what major and minor revision is installed and the precise of version of Windows, but some other information may be required to make a reliable choice of target. NX, ASLR and Windows 8+ anti-ROP mitigations are bypassed. On Windows 8+, it has a reliability of around 85%. On other versions of Windows, reliability is around 35% (due to the need to win a race condition across the network in this case; this may drop further depending on network conditions). The agent is normally installed on all hosts in a domain that need to be backed up, so if one service crashes, try again on another :) Successful exploitation will give remote code execution as the user of the Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows service, almost always NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM."

exploit,windows/browser/aventail_epi_activex,"This module exploits a format string vulnerability within version 10.0.4.x and 10.5.1 of the SonicWALL Aventail SSL-VPN Endpoint Interrogator/Installer ActiveX control (epi.dll). By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer. Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer. NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time."

exploit,windows/browser/ie_setmousecapture_uaf,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability that currents targets Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7, but the flaw should exist in versions 6/7/8/9/10/11. It was initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such as English, Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well. The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture function handles a reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture() calls to trigger, one for the parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() call for the child element is called, it finally triggers the event, which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary memory release using document.write(), which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the free, an invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more functions, eventuall this arrives in function MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or arbitrary code execution) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00). To mimic the same exploit found in the wild, this module will try to use the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage the attack."
exploit,windows/browser/ie_unsafe_scripting,"This exploit takes advantage of the ""Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting"" setting within Internet Explorer. When this option is set, IE allows access to the WScript.Shell ActiveX control, which allows javascript to interact with the file system and run commands. This security flaw is not uncommon in corporate environments for the 'Intranet' or 'Trusted Site' zones. When set via domain policy, the most common registry entry to modify is HKLM\ Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1\1201, which if set to '0' forces ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting to be enabled for the Intranet zone. This module creates a javascript/html hybrid that will render correctly either via a direct GET http://msf-server/ or as a javascript include, such as in: http://intranet-server/xss.asp?id=""><script%20src=http://10.10.10.10/ie_unsafe_script.js> </script>. IE Tabs, WScript and subsequent Powershell prompts all run as x86 even when run from an x64 iexplore.exe.

exploit,windows/browser/inotes_dwa85w_bof,"This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability on the UploadControl ActiveX. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the ""Attachment_Times"" property, due to the insecure usage of the _swscanf. The affected ActiveX is provided by the dwa85W.dll installed with the IBM Lotus iNotes ActiveX installer. This module has been tested successfully on IE6-IE9 on Windows XP, Vista and 7, using the dwa85W.dll 85.3.3.0 as installed with Lotus Domino 8.5.3. In order to bypass ASLR the no aslr compatible module dwabho.dll is used. This one is installed with the iNotes ActiveX."
exploit,windows/browser/intrust_annotatex_add,This module exploits an uninitialized variable vulnerability in the Annotation Objects ActiveX component. The ActiveX component loads into memory without opting into ALSR so this module exploits the vulnerability against windows Vista and Windows 7 targets. A large heap spray is required to fulfill the requirement that EAX points to part of the ROP chain in a heap chunk and the calculated call will hit the pivot in a separate heap chunk. This will take some time in the users browser.
exploit,windows/browser/java_basicservice_impl,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment that allows an attacker to escape the Java Sandbox. By injecting a parameter into a javaws call within the BasicServiceImpl class the default java sandbox policy file can be therefore overwritten. The vulnerability affects version 6 prior to update 22. NOTE: Exploiting this vulnerability causes several sinister-looking popup windows saying that Java is ""Downloading application."""
exploit,windows/browser/java_cmm,"This module abuses the Color Management classes from a Java Applet to run arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as exploited in the wild in February and March of 2013. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u15 and earlier and 6u41 and earlier and has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1 systems. This exploit doesn't bypass click-to-play, so the user must accept the java warning in order to run the malicious applet."
exploit,windows/browser/java_codebase_trust,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment that allows an attacker to run an applet outside of the Java Sandbox. When an applet is invoked with: 1. A ""codebase"" parameter that points at a trusted directory 2. A ""code"" parameter that is a URL that does not contain any dots the applet will run outside of the sandbox. This vulnerability affects JRE prior to version 6 update 24."
exploit,windows/browser/java_docbase_bof,"This module exploits a flaw in the new plugin component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment before v6 Update 22. By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. When the new plugin is invoked with a ""launchjnlp"" parameter, it will copy the contents of the ""docbase"" parameter to a stack-buffer using the ""sprintf"" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the ""WideCharToMultiByte"". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?'). This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release."
exploit,windows/browser/java_mixer_sequencer,"This module exploits a flaw within the handling of MixerSequencer objects in Java 6u18 and before. Exploitation id done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file within an RMF File. When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play the file, the GM_Song structure is populated with a function pointer provided by a SONG block in the RMF. A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event is used to trigger the vulnerability. When triggering the vulnerability ""ebx"" points to a fake event in the MIDI file which stores the shellcode. A ""jmp ebx"" from msvcr71.dll is used to make the exploit reliable over java updates."
exploit,windows/browser/java_ws_arginject_altjvm,"This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start plugin component of Sun Java Web Start. The arguments passed to Java Web Start are not properly validated. By passing the lesser known -J option, an attacker can pass arbitrary options directly to the Java runtime. By utilizing the -XXaltjvm option, as discussed by Ruben Santamarta, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of an unsuspecting browser user. This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Ruben Santamarta and Tavis Ormandy. Tavis reported that all versions since version 6 Update 10 ""are believed to be affected by this vulnerability."" In order for this module to work, it must be ran as root on a server that does not serve SMB. Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled."
exploit,windows/browser/java_ws_double_quote,"This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. Parameters initial-heap-size and max-heap-size in a JNLP file can contain a double quote which is not properly sanitized when creating the command line for javaw.exe. This allows the injection of the -XXaltjvm option to load a jvm.dll from a remote UNC path into the java process. Thus an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a browser user. This flaw was fixed in Oct. 2012 and affects JRE <= 1.6.35 and <= 1.7.07. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB (In most cases, this means non-Windows hosts). Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. Alternatively, a UNC path containing a jvm.dll can be specified, bypassing the Windows limitation for the Metasploit host."
exploit,windows/browser/java_ws_vmargs,"This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. The arguments passed to Java Web Start are not properly validated, allowing injection of arbitrary arguments to the JVM. By utilizing the lesser known -J option, an attacker can take advantage of the -XXaltjvm option, as discussed previously by Ruben Santamarta. This method allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an unsuspecting browser user. In order for this module to work, it must be run as root on a server that does not serve SMB. Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled."
exploit,windows/browser/juniper_sslvpn_ive_setupdll,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the JuniperSetupDLL.dll library which is called by the JuniperSetup.ocx ActiveX control, as part of the Juniper SSL-VPN (IVE) appliance. By specifying an overly long string to the ProductName object parameter, the stack is overwritten."

It is packaged in several products or GE, such as Proficy Historian 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, and 3.1, Proficy HMI/SCADA 5.1 and 5.0, Proficy Pulse 1.0, Proficy Batch Execution 5.6, and SI7 I/O Driver between 7.20 and 7.42. When the control is installed with these products, the function ""LaunchTriPane"" will use ShellExecute to launch ""hh.exe"", with user controlled data as parameters. Because of this, the ""-decompile"" option can be abused to write arbitrary files on the remote system. Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute it. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista. On the other hand, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3"
exploit,windows/browser/logitechvideocall_start,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Logitech VideoCall ActiveX Control (wcamxmp.dll 2.0.3470.448). By sending an overly long string to the ""Start()"" method, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code."

exploit,windows/browser/mirc_irc_url,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in mIRC 6.1. By submitting an overly long and specially crafted URL to the 'irc' protocol, an attacker can overwrite the buffer and control program execution."
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_attribchildremoved,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox 8/8.0.1 and 9/9.0.1. Removal of child nodes from the nsDOMAttribute can allow for a child to still be accessible after removal due to a premature notification of AttributeChildRemoved. Since mFirstChild is not set to NULL until after this call is made, this means the removed child will be accessible after it has been removed. By carefully manipulating the memory layout, this can lead to arbitrary code execution."
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_firefox_onreadystatechange,"This module exploits a vulnerability found on Firefox 17.0.6, specifically a use after free of a DocumentViewerImpl object, triggered via a specially crafted web page using onreadystatechange events and the window.stop() API, as exploited in the wild on 2013 August to target Tor Browser users."
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_firefox_xmlserializer,"This module exploits a vulnerability found on Firefox 17.0 (< 17.0.2), specifically a use-after-free of an Element object, when using the serializeToStream method with a specially crafted OutputStream defining its own write function. This module has been tested successfully with Firefox 17.0.1 ESR, 17.0.1 and 17.0 on Windows XP SP3."
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_interleaved_write,This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox caused by interleaved calls to document.write and appendChild. This module was written based on a live exploit found in the wild.
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_mchannel,"This module exploits a use after free vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.16. An OBJECT Element mChannel can be freed via the OnChannelRedirect method of the nsIChannelEventSink Interface. mChannel becomes a dangling pointer and can be reused when setting the OBJECTs data attribute. (Discovered by regenrecht). This module uses heapspray with a minimal ROP chain to bypass DEP on Windows XP SP3. Additionlay, a windows 7 target was provided using JAVA 6 and below to avoid aslr."
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_nssvgvalue,"This module exploits an out-of-bounds access flaw in Firefox 7 and 8 (<= 8.0.1). The notification of nsSVGValue observers via nsSVGValue::NotifyObservers(x,y) uses a loop which can result in an out-of-bounds access to attacker-controlled memory. The mObserver ElementAt() function (which picks up pointers), does not validate if a given index is out of bound. If a custom observer of nsSVGValue is created, which removes elements from the original observer, and memory layout is manipulated properly, the ElementAt() function might pick up an attacker provided pointer, which can be leveraged to gain remote arbitrary code execution."
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_nstreerange,This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x <= 3.6.16 and 3.5.x <= 3.5.17 found in nsTreeSelection. By overwriting a subfunction of invalidateSelection it is possible to free the nsTreeRange object that the function currently operates on. Any further operations on the freed object can result in remote code execution. Utilizing the call setup the function provides it's possible to bypass DEP without the need for a ROP. Sadly this exploit is still either dependent on Java or bound by ASLR because Firefox doesn't employ any ASLR-free modules anymore.
exploit,windows/browser/mozilla_reduceright,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Mozilla Firefox 3.6. When an array object is configured with a large length value, the reduceRight() method may cause an invalid index being used, allowing arbitrary remote code execution. Please note that the exploit requires a longer amount of time (compare to a typical browser exploit) in order to gain control of the machine."
exploit,windows/browser/ms03_020_ie_objecttype,This module exploits a vulnerability in Internet Explorer's handling of the OBJECT type attribute.
exploit,windows/browser/ms05_054_onload,"This bug is triggered when the browser handles a JavaScript 'onLoad' handler in conjunction with an improperly initialized 'window()' JavaScript function. This exploit results in a call to an address lower than the heap. The javascript prompt() places our shellcode near where the call operand points to. We call prompt() multiple times in separate iframes to place our return address. We hide the prompts in a popup window behind the main window. We spray the heap a second time with our shellcode and point the return address to the heap. I use a fairly high address to make this exploit more reliable. IE will crash when the exploit completes. Also, please note that Internet Explorer must allow popups in order to continue exploitation."
exploit,windows/browser/ms06_001_wmf_setabortproc,This module exploits a vulnerability in the GDI library included with Windows XP and 2003. This vulnerability uses the 'Escape' metafile function to execute arbitrary code through the SetAbortProc procedure. This module generates a random WMF record stream for each request.
exploit,windows/browser/ms06_013_createtextrange,"This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both IE6 and IE7 (Beta 2) are vulnerable. It will corrupt memory in a way, which, under certain circumstances, can lead to an invalid/corrupt table pointer dereference. EIP will point to a very remote, non-existent memory location. This module is the result of merging three different exploit submissions and has only been reliably tested against Windows XP SP2. This vulnerability was independently discovered by multiple parties. The heap spray method used by this exploit was pioneered by Skylined."
exploit,windows/browser/ms06_055_vml_method,"This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer using a buffer overflow in the VML processing code (VGX.dll). This module has been tested on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP0, and Windows XP SP2."
exploit,windows/browser/ms06_057_webview_setslice,"This module exploits a flaw in the WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX control included with Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003. This flaw was published during the Month of Browser Bugs project (MoBB #18)."

exploit,windows/browser/ms06_071_xml_core,"This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services which exists in the XMLHTTP ActiveX control. This module is the modified version of http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/2743 - credit to str0ke. This module has been successfully tested on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP2, Windows 2003 Server SP0 with IE6 + Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 SP2."
exploit,windows/browser/ms07_017_ani_loadimage_chunksize,"This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the LoadAniIcon() function in USER32.dll. The flaw can be triggered through Internet Explorer 6 and 7 by using the CURSOR style sheet directive to load a malicious .ANI file. The module can also exploit Mozilla Firefox by using a UNC path in a moz-icon URL and serving the .ANI file over WebDAV. The vulnerable code in USER32.dll will catch any exceptions that occur while the invalid cursor is loaded, causing the exploit to silently fail when the wrong target has been chosen. This vulnerability was discovered by Alexander Sotirov of Determina and was rediscovered, in the wild, by McAfee."
exploit,windows/browser/ms08_041_snapshotviewer,This module allows remote attackers to place arbitrary files on a users file system via the Microsoft Office Snapshot Viewer ActiveX Control.
exploit,windows/browser/ms08_053_mediaencoder,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Windows Media Encoder 9. When sending an overly long string to the GetDetailsString() method of wmex.dll an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.
exploit,windows/browser/ms08_070_visual_studio_msmask,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Microsoft's Visual Studio 6.0. When passing a specially crafted string to the Mask parameter of the Mdmask32.ocx ActiveX Control, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code."
exploit,windows/browser/ms08_078_xml_corruption,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the data binding feature of Internet Explorer. In order to execute code reliably, this module uses the .NET DLL memory technique pioneered by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd. This method is used to create a fake vtable at a known location with all methods pointing to our payload. Since the .text segment of the .NET DLL is non-writable, a prefixed code stub is used to copy the payload into a new memory segment and continue execution from there."
exploit,windows/browser/ms09_002_memory_corruption,This module exploits an error related to the CFunctionPointer function when attempting to access uninitialized memory. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the victim.
exploit,windows/browser/ms09_043_owc_htmlurl,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in Microsoft's Office Web Components. When passing an overly long string as the ""HTMLURL"" parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary code."
exploit,windows/browser/ms09_043_owc_msdso,This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within versions 10 and 11 of the Office Web Component Spreadsheet ActiveX control. This module was based on an exploit found in the wild.
exploit,windows/browser/ms09_072_style_object,This module exploits a vulnerability in the getElementsByTagName function as implemented within Internet Explorer.
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_002_aurora,"This module exploits a memory corruption flaw in Internet Explorer. This flaw was found in the wild and was a key component of the ""Operation Aurora"" attacks that lead to the compromise of a number of high profile companies. The exploit code is a direct port of the public sample published to the Wepawet malware analysis site. The technique used by this module is currently identical to the public sample, as such, only Internet Explorer 6 can be reliably exploited."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_002_ie_object,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Internet Explorer's mshtml component. Due to the way IE handles objects in memory, it is possible to cause a pointer in CTableRowCellsCollectionCacheItem::GetNext to be used even after it gets freed, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of the user. This particular vulnerability was also one of 2012's Pwn2Own challenges, and was later explained by Peter Vreugdenhil with exploitation details. Instead of Peter's method, this module uses heap spraying like the 99% to store a specially crafted memory layout before re-using the freed memory."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_018_ie_behaviors,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability within the DHTML behaviors functionality of Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7. This bug was discovered being used in-the-wild and was previously known as the ""iepeers"" vulnerability. The name comes from Microsoft's suggested workaround to block access to the iepeers.dll file. According to Nico Waisman, ""The bug itself is when trying to persist an object using the setAttribute, which end up calling VariantChangeTypeEx with both the source and the destination being the same variant. So if you send as a variant an IDISPATCH the algorithm will try to do a VariantClear of the destination before using it. This will end up on a call to PlainRelease which deref the reference and clean the object."" NOTE: Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 5 are not affected."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_018_ie_tabular_activex,"This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability in the Internet Explorer Tabular Data ActiveX Control. Microsoft reports that version 5.01 and 6 of Internet Explorer are vulnerable. By specifying a long value as the ""DataURL"" parameter to this control, it is possible to write a NUL byte outside the bounds of an array. By targeting control flow data on the stack, an attacker can execute arbitrary code."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_022_ie_vbscript_winhlp32,"This module exploits a code execution vulnerability that occurs when a user presses F1 on MessageBox originated from VBscript within a web page. When the user hits F1, the MessageBox help functionality will attempt to load and use a HLP file from an SMB or WebDAV (if the WebDAV redirector is enabled) server. This particular version of the exploit implements a WebDAV server that will serve HLP file as well as a payload EXE. During testing warnings about the payload EXE being unsigned were witnessed. A future version of this module might use other methods that do not create such a warning."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_026_avi_nsamplespersec,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in l3codecx.ax while processing a AVI files with MPEG Layer-3 audio contents. The overflow only allows to overwrite with 0's so the three least significant bytes of EIP saved on stack are overwritten and shellcode is mapped using the .NET DLL memory technique pioneered by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd. Please note on IE 8 targets, your malicious URL must be a trusted site in order to load the .Net control."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_042_helpctr_xss_cmd_exec,"Help and Support Center is the default application provided to access online documentation for Microsoft Windows. Microsoft supports accessing help documents directly via URLs by installing a protocol handler for the scheme ""hcp"". Due to an error in validation of input to hcp:// combined with a local cross site scripting vulnerability and a specialized mechanism to launch the XSS trigger, arbitrary command execution can be achieved. On IE7 on XP SP2 or SP3, code execution is automatic. If WMP9 is installed, it can be used to launch the exploit automatically. If IE8 and WMP11, either can be used to launch the attack, but both pop dialog boxes asking the user if execution should continue. This exploit detects if non-intrusive mechanisms are available and will use one if possible. In the case of both IE8 and WMP11, the exploit defaults to using an iframe on IE8, but is configurable by setting the DIALOGMECH option to ""none"" or ""player"". This module creates a WebDAV service from which the payload is copied to the victim machine."
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_046_shortcut_icon_dllloader,This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain an icon resource pointing to a malicious DLL. This module creates a WebDAV service that can be used to run an arbitrary payload when accessed as a UNC path.
exploit,windows/browser/ms10_090_ie_css_clip,"This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft's HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a specially crafted CSS tag, memory corruption occurs that can lead arbitrary code execution. It seems like Microsoft code inadvertently increments a vtable pointer to point to an unaligned address within the vtable's function pointers. This leads to the program counter being set to the address determined by the address ""[vtable+0x30+1]"". The particular address depends on the exact version of the mshtml library in use. Since the address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may not be exploitable. Specifically, those ending up with a program counter value within another module, in kernel space, or just not able to be reached with various memory spraying techniques. Also, since the address is not controllable, it is unlikely to be possible to use ROP to bypass non-executable memory protections."
exploit,windows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import,"This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft\'s HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a recursive CSS import, a C++ object is deleted and later reused. This leads to arbitrary code execution. This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed."
exploit,windows/browser/ms11_050_mshtml_cobjectelement,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability occurs when an invalid <object> tag exists and other elements overlap/cover where the object tag should be when rendered (due to their styles/positioning). The mshtml!CObjectElement is then freed from memory because it is invalid. However, the mshtml!CDisplay object for the page continues to keep a reference to the freed <object> and attempts to call a function on it, leading to the use-after-free. Please note that for IE 8 targets, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention)."
exploit,windows/browser/ms11_081_option,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. A memory corruption may occur when the Option cache isn't updated properly, which allows other JavaScript methods to access a deleted Option element, and results in code execution under the context of the user."
exploit,windows/browser/ms11_093_ole32,"This module exploits a type confusion vulnerability in the OLE32 component of Windows XP SP3. The vulnerability exists in the CPropertyStorage::ReadMultiple function. A Visio document with a specially crafted Summary Information Stream embedded allows to get remote code execution through Internet Explorer, on systems with Visio Viewer installed."
exploit,windows/browser/ms12_004_midi,"This module exploits a heap overflow vulnerability in the Windows Multimedia Library (winmm.dll). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MIDI files. Remote code execution can be achieved by using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file with specific events, causing the offset calculation being higher than what is available on the heap (0x400 allocated by WINMM!winmmAlloc), and then allowing us to either ""inc al"" or ""dec al"" a byte. This can be used to corrupt an array (CImplAry) we setup, and force the browser to confuse types from tagVARIANT objects, which leverages remote code execution under the context of the user. Note: At this time, for IE 8 target, msvcrt ROP is used by default. However, if you know your target's patch level, you may also try the 'MSHTML' advanced option for an info leak based attack. Currently, this module only supports two MSHTML builds: 8.0.6001.18702, which is often seen in a newly installed XP SP3. Or 8.0.6001.19120, which is patch level before the MS12-004 fix. Also, based on our testing, the vulnerability does not seem to trigger when the victim machine is operated via rdesktop."
exploit,windows/browser/ms12_037_ie_colspan,"This module exploits a heap overflow vulnerability in Internet Explorer caused by an incorrect handling of the span attribute for col elements from a fixed table, when they are modified dynamically by javascript code."
exploit,windows/browser/ms12_037_same_id,This module exploits a memory corruption flaw in Internet Explorer 8 when handling objects with the same ID property. At the moment this module targets IE8 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7. This module supports heap massaging as well as the heap spray method seen in the wild (Java msvcrt71.dll).
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_009_ie_slayoutrun_uaf,This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer where a CParaElement node is released but a reference is still kept in CDoc. This memory is reused when a CDoc relayout is performed.
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_022_silverlight_script_object,"This module exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Silverlight. The vulnerability exists on the Initialize() method from System.Windows.Browser.ScriptObject, which access memory in an unsafe manner. Since it is accessible for untrusted code (user controlled) it's possible to dereference arbitrary memory which easily leverages to arbitrary code execution. In order to bypass DEP/ASLR a second vulnerability is used, in the public WriteableBitmap class from System.Windows.dll. This module has been tested successfully on IE6 - IE10, Windows XP SP3 / Windows 7 SP1."
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_037_svg_dashstyle,"This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability on Internet Explorer. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the dashstyle.array length for vml shapes on the vgx.dll module. The exploit has been built and tested specifically against Windows 7 SP1 with Internet Explorer 8. It uses either JRE6 or an information leak (to ntdll) to bypass ASLR, and by default the info leak is used. To make sure the leak is successful, the ntdll version should be either v6.1.7601.17514 (the default dll version on a newly installed/unpatched Windows 7 SP1), or ntdll.dll v6.1.7601.17725 (installed after apply MS12-001). If the target doesn't have the version the exploit wants, it will refuse to attack by sending a fake 404 message (webpage not found). If you wish to try the JRE6 component instead to bypass ASLR, you can set the advanced datastore option to 'JRE6'. If JRE6 is chosen but the target doesn't have this particular component, the exploit will also refuse to attack by sending a 404 message."
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_055_canchor,"In IE8 standards mode, it's possible to cause a use-after-free condition by first creating an illogical table tree, where a CPhraseElement comes after CTableRow, with the final node being a sub table element. When the CPhraseElement's outer content is reset by using either outerText or outerHTML through an event handler, this triggers a free of its child element (in this case, a CAnchorElement, but some other objects apply too), but a reference is still kept in function SRunPointer::SpanQualifier. This function will then pass on the invalid reference to the next functions, eventually used in mshtml!CElement::Doc when it's trying to make a call to the object's SecurityContext virtual function at offset +0x70, which results a crash. An attacker can take advantage of this by first creating an CAnchorElement object, let it free, and then replace the freed memory with another fake object. Successfully doing so may allow arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. This bug is specific to Internet Explorer 8 only. It was originally discovered by Jose Antonio Vazquez Gonzalez and reported to iDefense, but was discovered again by Orange Tsai at Hitcon 2013."
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_059_cflatmarkuppointer,"This is a memory corruption bug found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. On IE 9, it seems to only affect certain releases of mshtml.dll, ranging from a newly installed IE9 (9.0.8112.16446), to 9.00.8112.16502 (July 2013 update). IE8 requires a different way to trigger the vulnerability, but not currently covered by this module. The issue is specific to the browser's IE7 document compatibility, which can be defined in X-UA-Compatible, and the content editable mode must be enabled. An ""onmove"" event handler is also necessary to be able to trigger the bug, and the event will be run twice before the crash. The first time is due to the position change of the body element, which is also when a MSHTML!CFlatMarkupPointer::`vftable' object is created during a ""SelectAll"" command, and this object will be used later on for the crash. The second onmove event seems to be triggered by a InsertButton (or Insert-whatever) command, which is also responsible for the free of object CFlatMarkupPointer during page rendering. The EnsureRecalcNotify() function will then still return an invalid reference to CFlatMarkupPointer (stored in EBX), and then passes this on to the next functions (GetLineInfo -> QIClassID). When this reference arrives in function QIClassID, an access violation finally occurs when the function is trying to call QueryInterface() with the bad reference, and this results a crash. Successful control of the freed memory may leverage arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. Note: It is also possible to see a different object being freed and used, doesn't always have to be CFlatMarkupPointer."
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_069_caret,"This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability found in Internet Explorer, specifically in how the browser handles the caret (text cursor) object. In IE's standards mode, the caret handling's vulnerable state can be triggered by first setting up an editable page with an input field, and then we can force the caret to update in an onbeforeeditfocus event by setting the body's innerHTML property. In this event handler, mshtml!CCaret::`vftable' can be freed using a document.write() function, however, mshtml!CCaret::UpdateScreenCaret remains unaware of this change, and still uses the same reference to the CCaret object. When the function tries to use this invalid reference to call a virtual function at offset 0x2c, it finally results a crash. Precise control of the freed object allows arbitrary code execution under the context of the user."
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_080_cdisplaypointer,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It was originally found being exploited in the wild targeting Japanese and Korean IE8 users on Windows XP, around the same time frame as CVE-2013-3893, except this was kept out of the public eye by multiple research companies and the vendor until the October patch release. This issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in CDisplayPointer via the use of a ""onpropertychange"" event handler. To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element. If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen: a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another event called ""onselect"". The ""onselect"" event will allow us to set up for the actual event handler we want to abuse - the ""onpropertychange"" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in ""onselect"", this will trigger ""onpropertychange"". During ""onpropertychange"" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer object can be forced by using an ""Unselect"" (other approaches also apply), but a reference of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user."
exploit,windows/browser/ms13_090_cardspacesigninhelper,"This module exploits a vulnerability on the CardSpaceClaimCollection class from the icardie.dll ActiveX control. The vulnerability exists while the handling of the CardSpaceClaimCollection object. CardSpaceClaimCollections stores a collection of elements on a SafeArray and keeps a size field, counting the number of elements on the collection. By calling the remove() method on an empty CardSpaceClaimCollection it is possible to underflow the length field, storing a negative integer. Later, a call to the add() method will use the corrupted length field to compute the address where write into the SafeArray data, allowing to corrupt memory with a pointer to controlled contents. This module achieves code execution by using VBScript as discovered in the wild on November 2013 to (1) create an array of html OBJECT elements, (2) create holes, (3) create a CardSpaceClaimCollection whose SafeArray data will reuse one of the holes, (4) corrupt one of the legit OBJECT elements with the described integer overflow and (5) achieve code execution by forcing the use of the corrupted OBJECT."

exploit,windows/fileformat/ibm_pcm_ws,"The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located on the runtime program stack. When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character. It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character. The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer. To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at 0x74 which is used as an argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as an id file extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was corrupted. This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.

exploit,windows/fileformat/microsoft_windows_contact,"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The flaw is due to the processing of "".contact"" files <c:Url> node param which takes an expected website value, however if an attacker references an executable file it will run that instead without warning instead of performing expected web navigation. This is dangerous and would be unexpected to an end user. Executable files can live in a sub-directory so when the "".contact"" website link is clicked it traverses directories towards the executable and runs. Making matters worse is if the the files are compressed then downloaded ""mark of the web"" (MOTW) may potentially not work as expected with certain archive utilitys. The "".\"" chars allow directory traversal to occur in order to run the attackers supplied executable sitting unseen in the attackers directory.

This module does not attempt to exploit the vulnerability via Microsoft Outlook. The Microsoft Word RTF parser was only used by default in versions of Microsoft Word itself prior to Office 2007. With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft began using the Word RTF parser, by default, to handle rich-text messages within Outlook as well. It was possible to configure Outlook 2003 and earlier to use the Microsoft Word engine too, but it was not a default setting. It appears as though Microsoft Office 2000 is not vulnerable.

exploit,windows/fileformat/ms14_060_sandworm,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as ""Sandworm"". Platforms such as Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function. This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target. In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly. As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file, and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's actually the payload, and the second for the INF file. The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the type and cmd property. In the exploit, ""verb"" media command type is used, and this triggers the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, ""-3"" is used as the fake gif file's cmd property, and ""3"" is used for the INF. When the cmd is ""-3"", DoVerb will bail. But when ""3"" is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate handler for it, which will end up with C:\Windows\System32\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution."

exploit,windows/fileformat/mswin_tiff_overflow,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft's Tagged Image File Format. It was originally discovered in the wild, targeting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users running Microsoft Office, specifically in the Middle East and South Asia region. The flaw is due to a DWORD value extracted from the TIFF file that is embedded as a drawing in Microsoft Office, and how it gets calculated with user-controlled inputs, and stored in the EAX register. The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to represent the large value, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a dwBytes argument (size) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a chunk anyway with size 0, and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer of a memcpy function, where the source buffer is the EXIF data (an extended image format supported by TIFF), and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function, and then later used in OGL!GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer, and the memory layout using ActiveX, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user."

exploit,windows/ftp/vermillion_ftpd_port,"This module exploits an out-of-bounds array access in the Arcane Software Vermillion FTP server. By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using ""vftpd.exe install"". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt."
exploit,windows/ftp/warftpd_165_pass,This exploits the buffer overflow found in the PASS command in War-FTPD 1.65. This particular module will only work reliably against Windows 2000 targets.

exploit,windows/http/hp_mpa_job_acct,"This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability on HP Managed Printing Administration 2.6.3 and prior versions. The vulnerability exists in the UploadFiles() function from the MPAUploader.Uploader.1 control, loaded and used by the server. The function can be abused via directory traversal and null byte injection in order to achieve arbitrary file upload. In order to exploit successfully, a few conditions must be met. First, a writable location under the context of Internet Guest Account (IUSR_*) or Everyone is required. By default, this module will attempt to write to /hpmpa/userfiles/, but the WRITEWEBFOLDER option can be used to provide another writable path. Second, the writable path must also be readable by a browser, so this typically means a location under wwwroot. Finally, you cannot overwrite a file with the same name as the payload."

exploit,windows/http/hp_nnm_ovas,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager versions 7.53 and earlier. Specifically this vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle user supplied input within the HTTP request including headers and the actual URL GET request. Exploitation is tricky due to character restrictions. It was necessary to utilize a egghunter shellcode which was alphanumeric encoded by muts in the original exploit. If you plan on using exploit this for a remote shell, you will likely want to migrate to a different process as soon as possible. Any connections get reset after a short period of time.

The vulnerable code is within the ""_OVBuildPath"" function within ""ov.dll"". There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is achieved by overwriting the saved return address. The vulnerability is due to the use of the function ""_OVConcatPath"" which finally uses ""strcat"" in an insecure way. User controlled data is concatenated to a string which contains the OpenView installation path. To achieve reliable exploitation a directory traversal in OpenView5.exe (OSVDB 44359) is being used to retrieve OpenView logs and disclose the installation path.

Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected. The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest() handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly checking if the attacker is authenticated or not. This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a ""parameters"" XML tag is found in the attacker's request. Then for each subelement named ""parameter"", the code will check that it has a name and if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4 of the ""getsystem"" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution."
exploit,windows/http/solarwinds_fsm_userlogin,"This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found in Solarwinds Firewall Security Manager 6.6.5. The first vulnerability is an authentication bypass via the Change Advisor interface due to a user-controlled session.putValue API in userlogin.jsp, allowing the attacker to set the 'username' attribute before authentication. The second problem is that the settings-new.jsp file will only check the 'username' attribute before authorizing the 'uploadFile' action, which can be exploited and allows the attacker to upload a fake xls host list file to the server, and results in arbitrary code execution under the context of SYSTEM. Depending on the installation, by default the Change Advisor web server is listening on port 48080 for an express install. Otherwise, this service may appear on port 8080.

exploit,windows/http/ultraminihttp_bof,"This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Ultra Mini HTTPD 1.21, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long resource name in an HTTP request. This exploit has to deal with the fact that the application's request handler thread is terminated after 60 seconds by a ""monitor"" thread. To do this, it allocates some RWX memory, copies the payload to it and creates another thread. When done, it terminates the current thread so that it doesn't crash and hence doesn't bring down the process with it."
exploit,windows/http/umbraco_upload_aspx,"This module can be used to execute a payload on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378. The payload is uploaded as an ASPX script by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to codeEditorSave.asmx, which permits unauthorized file upload via the SaveDLRScript operation. SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible /umbraco/ directory. The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target.

exploit,windows/local/bypassuac_comhijack,"This module will bypass Windows UAC by creating COM handler registry entries in the HKCU hive. When certain high integrity processes are loaded, these registry entries are referenced resulting in the process loading user-controlled DLLs. These DLLs contain the payloads that result in elevated sessions. Registry key modifications are cleaned up after payload invocation. This module requires the architecture of the payload to match the OS, but the current low-privilege Meterpreter session architecture can be different. If specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process. This module invokes the target binary via cmd.exe on the target. Therefore if cmd.exe access is restricted, this module will not run correctly."

exploit,windows/local/cve_2020_17136,"The Cloud Filter driver, cldflt.sys, on Windows 10 v1803 and later, prior to the December 2020 updates, did not set the IO_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK or OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK flags when calling FltCreateFileEx() and FltCreateFileEx2() within its HsmpOpCreatePlaceholders() function with attacker controlled input. This meant that files were created with KernelMode permissions, thereby bypassing any security checks that would otherwise prevent a normal user from being able to create files in directories they don't have permissions to create files in. This module abuses this vulnerability to perform a DLL hijacking attack against the Microsoft Storage Spaces SMP service, which grants the attacker code execution as the NETWORK SERVICE user. Users are strongly encouraged to set the PAYLOAD option to one of the Meterpreter payloads, as doing so will allow them to subsequently escalate their new session from NETWORK SERVICE to SYSTEM by using Meterpreter's ""getsystem"" command to perform RPCSS Named Pipe Impersonation and impersonate the SYSTEM user."

exploit,windows/local/cve_2021_40449,"A use after free vulnerability exists in the `NtGdiResetDC()` function of Win32k which can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The flaw exists due to the fact that this function calls `hdcOpenDCW()`, which performs a user mode callback. During this callback, attackers can call the `NtGdiResetDC()` function again with the same handle as before, which will result in the PDC object that is referenced by this handle being freed. The attacker can then replace the memory referenced by the handle with their own object, before passing execution back to the original `NtGdiResetDC()` call, which will now use the attacker's object without appropriate validation. This can then allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the kernel and, together with additional exploitation techniques, gain code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This module has been tested to work on Windows 10 x64 RS1 (build 14393) and RS5 (build 17763), however previous versions of Windows 10 will likely also work."
exploit,windows/local/cve_2022_21882_win32k,"A vulnerability exists within win32k that can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The flaw exists in how the WndExtra field of a window can be manipulated into being treated as an offset despite being populated by an attacker-controlled value. This can be leveraged to achieve an out of bounds write operation, eventually leading to privilege escalation. This flaw was originally identified as CVE-2021-1732 and was patched by Microsoft on February 9th, 2021. In early 2022, a technique to bypass the patch was identified and assigned CVE-2022-21882. The root cause is is the same for both vulnerabilities. This exploit combines the patch bypass with the original exploit to function on a wider range of Windows 10 targets."
exploit,windows/local/cve_2022_21999_spoolfool_privesc,"The Windows Print Spooler has a privilege escalation vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve code execution as SYSTEM. The `SpoolDirectory`, a configuration setting that holds the path that a printer's spooled jobs are sent to, is writable for all users, and it can be configured via `SetPrinterDataEx()` provided the caller has the `PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER` permission. If the `SpoolDirectory` path does not exist, it will be created once the print spooler reinitializes. Calling `SetPrinterDataEx()` with the `CopyFiles\` registry key will load the dll passed in as the `pData` argument, meaning that writing a dll to the `SpoolDirectory` location can be loaded by the print spooler. Using a directory junction and UNC path for the `SpoolDirectory`, the exploit writes a payload to `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\4` and loads it by calling `SetPrinterDataEx()`, resulting in code execution as SYSTEM."
exploit,windows/local/cve_2022_26904_superprofile,"The user profile service, identified as ProfSrv, is vulnerable to a local privilege elevation vulnerability in its CreateDirectoryJunction() function due to a lack of appropriate checks on the directory structure of the junctions it tries to link together. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to plant a malicious DLL in a system directory and then trigger a UAC prompt to cause this DLL to be loaded and executed by ProfSrv as the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. Note that this bug was originally identified as CVE-2021-34484 and was subsequently patched a second time as CVE-2022-21919, however both patches were found to be insufficient. This bug is a patch bypass for CVE-2022-21919 and at the time of publishing, has not yet been patched, though plans are in place to patch it as CVE-2022-26904. It is important to note that the credentials supplied for the second user to log in as in this exploit must be those of a normal non-admin user and these credentials must also corralate with a user who has already logged in at least once before. Additionally the current user running the exploit must have UAC set to the highest level, aka ""Always Notify Me When"", in order for the code to be executed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Note however that ""Always Notify Me When"" is the default UAC setting on common Windows installs, so this would only affect instances where this setting has been changed either manually or as part of the installation process."
exploit,windows/local/dnsadmin_serverlevelplugindll,"This module exploits a feature in the DNS service of Windows Server. Users of the DnsAdmins group can set the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value using dnscmd.exe to create a registry key at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\` named `ServerLevelPluginDll` that can be made to point to an arbitrary DLL. After doing so, restarting the service will load the DLL and cause it to execute, providing us with SYSTEM privileges. Increasing WfsDelay is recommended when using a UNC path. Users should note that if the DLLPath variable of this module is set to a UNC share that does not exist, the DNS server on the target will not be able to restart. Similarly if a UNC share is not utilized, and users instead opt to drop a file onto the disk of the target computer, and this gets picked up by Anti-Virus after the timeout specified by `AVTIMEOUT` expires, its possible that the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value of the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\` key on the target computer may point to an nonexistant DLL, which will also prevent the DNS server from being able to restart. Users are advised to refer to the documentation for this module for advice on how to resolve this issue should it occur. This module has only been tested and confirmed to work on Windows Server 2019 Standard Edition, however it should work against any Windows Server version up to and including Windows Server 2019."

exploit,windows/local/ntapphelpcachecontrol,"On Windows, the system call NtApphelpCacheControl (the code is actually in ahcache.sys) allows application compatibility data to be cached for quick reuse when new processes are created. A normal user can query the cache but cannot add new cached entries as the operation is restricted to administrators. This is checked in the function AhcVerifyAdminContext. This function has a vulnerability where it doesn't correctly check the impersonation token of the caller to determine if the user is an administrator. It reads the caller's impersonation token using PsReferenceImpersonationToken and then does a comparison between the user SID in the token to LocalSystem's SID. It doesn't check the impersonation level of the token so it's possible to get an identify token on your thread from a local system process and bypass this check. This module currently only affects Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, and requires access to C:\Windows\System\ComputerDefaults.exe (although this can be improved)."
exploit,windows/local/ntusermndragover,"This module exploits a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in MNGetpItemFromIndex(), which is reachable via a NtUserMNDragOver() system call. The NULL pointer dereference occurs because the xxxMNFindWindowFromPoint() function does not effectively check the validity of the tagPOPUPMENU objects it processes before passing them on to MNGetpItemFromIndex(), where the NULL pointer dereference will occur. This module has been tested against Windows 7 x86 SP0 and SP1. Offsets within the solution may need to be adjusted to work with other versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2008."

exploit,windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess,"A vulnerability exists in the latest version of Razer Synapse (v2.20.15.1104 as of the day of disclosure) which can be leveraged locally by a malicious application to elevate its privileges to those of NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability. This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part of the exploitation process."
exploit,windows/local/registry_persistence,"This module will install a payload that is executed during boot.

exploit,windows/local/ricoh_driver_privesc,"Various Ricoh printer drivers allow escalation of privileges on Windows systems. For vulnerable drivers, a low-privileged user can read/write files within the `RICOH_DRV` directory and its subdirectories. `PrintIsolationHost.exe`, a Windows process running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, loads driver-specific DLLs during the installation of a printer. A user can elevate to SYSTEM by writing a malicious DLL to the vulnerable driver directory and adding a new printer with a vulnerable driver. This module leverages the `prnmngr.vbs` script to add and delete printers. Multiple runs of this module may be required given successful exploitation is time-sensitive."
exploit,windows/local/run_as,"This module will login with the specified username/password and execute the supplied command as a hidden process. Output is not returned by default. Unless targeting a local user either set the DOMAIN, or specify a UPN user format (e.g. user@domain). This uses the CreateProcessWithLogonW WinAPI function. A custom command line can be sent instead of uploading an executable. APPLICAITON_NAME and COMMAND_LINE are passed to lpApplicationName and lpCommandLine respectively. See the MSDN documentation for how these two values interact."
exploit,windows/local/s4u_persistence,"Creates a scheduled task that will run using service-for-user (S4U). This allows the scheduled task to run even as an unprivileged user that is not logged into the device. This will result in lower security context, allowing access to local resources only. The module requires 'Logon as a batch job' permissions (SeBatchLogonRight)."
exploit,windows/local/service_permissions,"This module attempts to exploit existing administrative privileges to obtain a SYSTEM session. If directly creating a service fails, this module will inspect existing services to look for insecure configuration, file or registry permissions that may be hijacked. It will then attempt to restart the replaced service to run the payload. This will result in a new session when this succeeds."
exploit,windows/local/srclient_dll_hijacking,All editions of Windows Server 2012 (but not 2012 R2) are vulnerable to DLL hijacking due to the way TiWorker.exe will try to call the non-existent `SrClient.dll` file when Windows Update checks for updates. This issue can be leveraged for privilege escalation if %PATH% includes directories that are writable by low-privileged users. The attack can be triggered by any low-privileged user and does not require a system reboot. This module has been successfully tested on Windows Server 2012 (x64).
exploit,windows/local/tokenmagic,This module leverages a UAC bypass (TokenMagic) in order to spawn a process/conduct a DLL hijacking attack to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. Windows 7 through Windows 10 1803 are affected.
exploit,windows/local/unquoted_service_path,"This module exploits a logic flaw due to how the lpApplicationName parameter is handled. When the lpApplicationName contains a space, the file name is ambiguous. Take this file path as example: C:\program files\hello.exe; The Windows API will try to interpret this as two possible paths: C:\program.exe, and C:\program files\hello.exe, and then execute all of them. To some software developers, this is an unexpected behavior, which becomes a security problem if an attacker is able to place a malicious executable in one of these unexpected paths, sometimes escalate privileges if run as SYSTEM. Some software such as OpenVPN 2.1.1, OpenSSH Server 5, and others have the same problem. The offensive technique is also described in Writing Secure Code (2nd Edition), Chapter 23, in the section ""Calling Processes Security"" on page 676. This technique was previously called Trusted Service Path, but is more commonly known as Unquoted Service Path. The service exploited won't start until the payload written to disk is removed. Manual cleanup is required."
exploit,windows/local/virtual_box_guest_additions,A vulnerability within the VBoxGuest driver allows an attacker to inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently calling NtQueryIntervalProfile on Windows XP SP3 systems.

exploit,windows/local/webexec,"This module exploits a flaw in the 'webexservice' Windows service, which runs as SYSTEM, can be used to run arbitrary commands locally, and can be started by limited users in default installations."
exploit,windows/local/windscribe_windscribeservice_priv_esc,"The Windscribe VPN client application for Windows makes use of a Windows service `WindscribeService.exe` which exposes a named pipe `\.\pipe\WindscribeService` allowing execution of programs with elevated privileges. Windscribe versions prior to 1.82 do not validate user-supplied program names, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as SYSTEM. This module has been tested successfully on Windscribe versions 1.80 and 1.81 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64)."
exploit,windows/local/wmi,This module executes powershell on the remote host using the current user credentials or those supplied. Instead of using PSEXEC over TCP port 445 we use the WMIC command to start a Remote Procedure Call on TCP port 135 and an ephemeral port. Set ReverseListenerComm to tunnel traffic through that session. The result is similar to psexec but with the added benefit of using the session's current authentication token instead of having to know a password or hash. The remote host must be configured to allow remote Windows Management Instrumentation.
exploit,windows/local/wmi_persistence,"This module will create a permanent WMI event subscription to achieve file-less persistence using one of five methods. The EVENT method will create an event filter that will query the event log for an EVENT_ID_TRIGGER (default: failed logon request id 4625) that also contains a specified USERNAME_TRIGGER (note: failed logon auditing must be enabled on the target for this method to work, this can be enabled using ""auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:Logon /failure:Enable""). When these criteria are met a command line event consumer will trigger an encoded powershell payload. The INTERVAL method will create an event filter that triggers the payload after the specified CALLBACK_INTERVAL. The LOGON method will create an event filter that will trigger the payload after the system has an uptime of 4 minutes. The PROCESS method will create an event filter that triggers the payload when the specified process is started. The WAITFOR method creates an event filter that utilizes the Microsoft binary waitfor.exe to wait for a signal specified by WAITFOR_TRIGGER before executing the payload. The signal can be sent from a windows host on a LAN utilizing the waitfor.exe command (note: requires target to have port 445 open). Additionally a custom command can be specified to run once the trigger is activated using the advanced option CUSTOM_PS_COMMAND. This module requires administrator level privileges as well as a high integrity process. It is also recommended not to use stageless payloads due to powershell script length limitations."

exploit,windows/misc/ais_esel_server_rce,"This module will execute an arbitrary payload on an ""ESEL"" server used by the AIS logistic software. The server typically listens on port 5099 without TLS. There could also be server listening on 5100 with TLS but the port 5099 is usually always open. The login process is vulnerable to an SQL Injection. Usually a MSSQL Server with the 'sa' user is in place. This module was verified on version 67 but it should also run on lower versions. An fixed version was created by AIS in September 2017. However most systems have not been updated. In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any ""bind"" payload. You want a ""reverse"" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. Currently, one delivery method is supported This method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished."

exploit,windows/mssql/ms09_004_sp_replwritetovarbin,"A heap-based buffer overflow can occur when calling the undocumented ""sp_replwritetovarbin"" extended stored procedure. This vulnerability affects all versions of Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, Windows Internal Database, and Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) without the updates supplied in MS09-004. Microsoft patched this vulnerability in SP3 for 2005 without any public mention. An authenticated database session is required to access the vulnerable code. That said, it is possible to access the vulnerable code via an SQL injection vulnerability. This exploit smashes several pointers, as shown below. 1. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to 0 2. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to a length influenced by the buffer length. 3. pointer to a 32-bit value that is used as a vtable pointer. In MSSQL 2000, this value is referenced with a displacement of 0x38. For MSSQL 2005, the displacement is 0x10. The address of our buffer is conveniently stored in ecx when this instruction is executed. 4. On MSSQL 2005, an additional vtable ptr is smashed, which is referenced with a displacement of 4. This pointer is not used by this exploit. This particular exploit replaces the previous dual-method exploit. It uses a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there, return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and finally execute the payload via a ""jmp esp"". All addresses used were found within the sqlservr.exe memory space, yielding very reliable code execution using only a single query. NOTE: The MSSQL server service does not automatically restart by default. That said, some exceptions are caught and will not result in terminating the process. If the exploit crashes the service prior to hijacking the stack, it won't die. Otherwise, it's a goner."

The module requires working credentials in order to connect directly to the MSSQL Server. This method requires the user to have sufficient privileges to install a custom SQL CRL DLL, and invoke the custom stored procedure that comes with it. This exploit does not leave any binaries on disk. Tested on MS SQL Server versions: 2005, 2012, 2016 (all x64)."
exploit,windows/mssql/mssql_linkcrawler,"This module can be used to crawl MS SQL Server database links and deploy Metasploit payloads through links configured with sysadmin privileges using a valid SQL Server Login. If you are attempting to obtain multiple reverse shells using this module we recommend setting the ""DisablePayloadHandler"" advanced option to ""true"", and setting up a exploit/multi/handler to run in the background as a job to support multiple incoming shells. If you are interested in deploying payloads to specific servers this module also supports that functionality via the ""DEPLOYLIST"" option. Currently, the module is capable of delivering payloads to both 32bit and 64bit Windows systems via powershell memory injection methods based on Matthew Graeber's work. As a result, the target server must have powershell installed. By default, all of the crawl information is saved to a CSV formatted log file and MSF loot so that the tool can also be used for auditing without deploying payloads."
exploit,windows/mssql/mssql_payload,"This module executes an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server by using the ""xp_cmdshell"" stored procedure. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems. A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the payload on the target.

This module starts a WebDAV server to provide the malicious BCL files. If the target does not have the WebClient service enabled, an external SMB service is necessary."
exploit,windows/scada/iconics_genbroker,"The GenBroker service on port 38080 is affected by three integer overflow vulnerabilities while handling opcode 0x4b0, which is caused by abusing the the memory allocations needed for the number of elements passed by the client. This results unexpected behaviors such as direct registry calls, memory location calls, or arbitrary remote code execution. Please note that in order to ensure reliability, this exploit will try to open calc (hidden), inject itself into the process, and then open up a shell session. Also, DEP bypass is supported."
exploit,windows/scada/iconics_webhmi_setactivexguid,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in ICONICS WebHMI's ActiveX control. By supplying a long string of data to the 'SetActiveXGUID' parameter, GenVersion.dll fails to do any proper bounds checking before this input is copied onto the stack, which causes a buffer overflow, and results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user."
exploit,windows/scada/igss9_igssdataserver_listall,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the igssdataserver.exe component of 7-Technologies IGSS up to version 9.00.00 b11063. While processing a ListAll command, the application fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack. This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution. Also, after the payload exits, IGSSdataServer.exe should automatically recover."
exploit,windows/scada/igss9_igssdataserver_rename,"This module exploits a vulnerability found on 7-Technologies IGSS 9. By supplying a long string of data to the 'Rename' (0x02), 'Delete' (0x03), or 'Add' (0x04) command, a buffer overflow condition occurs in IGSSdataServer.exe while handing an RMS report, which results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. The attack is carried out in three stages. The first stage sends the final payload to IGSSdataServer.exe, which will remain in memory. The second stage sends the Add command so the process can find a valid ID for the Rename command. The last stage then triggers the vulnerability with the Rename command, and uses an egghunter to search for the shellcode that we sent in stage 1. The use of egghunter appears to be necessary due to the small buffer size, which cannot even contain our ROP chain and the final payload."
exploit,windows/scada/igss9_misc,"This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found on IGSS 9's Data Server and Data Collector services. The initial approach is first by transferring our binary with Write packets (opcode 0x0D) via port 12401 (igssdataserver.exe), and then send an EXE packet (opcode 0x0A) to port 12397 (dc.exe), which will cause dc.exe to run that payload with a CreateProcessA() function as a new thread."
exploit,windows/scada/igss_exec_17,"This module abuses a directory traversal flaw in Interactive Graphical SCADA System v9.00. In conjunction with the traversal flaw, if opcode 0x17 is sent to the dc.exe process, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary system commands."

This vulnerability is not related to the bit string vulnerability described in eEye advisory AD20040210-2. Both vulnerabilities were fixed in the MS04-007 patch. Windows 2000 SP4 Rollup 1 also patches this vulnerability. You are only allowed one attempt with this vulnerability. If the payload fails to execute, the LSASS system service will crash and the target system will automatically reboot itself in 60 seconds. If the payload succeeds, the system will no longer be able to process authentication requests, denying all attempts to login through SMB or at the console. A reboot is required to restore proper functioning of an exploited system. This exploit has been successfully tested with the win32/*/reverse_tcp payloads, however a few problems were encountered when using the equivalent bind payloads. Your mileage may vary."

It may be possible to satisfy this condition by using a custom DNS and LDAP setup, however that method is not covered here. Although Windows XP SP2 is vulnerable, Microsoft reports that Administrator credentials are required to reach the vulnerable code. Windows XP SP1 only requires valid user credentials. Also, testing shows that a machine already joined to a domain is not exploitable."
exploit,windows/smb/ms07_029_msdns_zonename,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the RPC interface of the Microsoft DNS service. The vulnerability is triggered when a long zone name parameter is supplied that contains escaped octal strings. This module is capable of bypassing NX/DEP protection on Windows 2003 SP1/SP2.

exploit,windows/smb/ms10_061_spoolss,"This module exploits the RPC service impersonation vulnerability detailed in Microsoft Bulletin MS10-061. By making a specific DCE RPC request to the StartDocPrinter procedure, an attacker can impersonate the Printer Spooler service to create a file. The working directory at the time is %SystemRoot%\system32. An attacker can specify any file name, including directory traversal or full paths. By sending WritePrinter requests, an attacker can fully control the content of the created file. In order to gain code execution, this module writes to a directory used by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to deploy applications. This directory (Wbem\Mof) is periodically scanned and any new .mof files are processed automatically. This is the same technique employed by the Stuxnet code found in the wild."
exploit,windows/smb/ms15_020_shortcut_icon_dllloader,"This module exploits a vulnerability in the MS10-046 patch to abuse (again) the handling of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain an icon resource pointing to a malicious DLL.

exploit,windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue,"This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads."
exploit,windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec,"This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to achieve a write-what-where primitive. This will then be used to overwrite the connection session information with as an Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec payload code execution is done. Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and WriteAndX requests and a race condition in Transaction requests, as seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue exploit, but requires a named pipe."

exploit,windows/smb/smb_doublepulsar_rce,"This module executes a Metasploit payload against the Equation Group's DOUBLEPULSAR implant for SMB as popularly deployed by ETERNALBLUE. While this module primarily performs code execution against the implant, the ""Neutralize implant"" target allows you to disable the implant."
exploit,windows/smb/smb_relay,"This module will relay SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this module. The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\SERVER\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When the victim views the web page or email, their system will automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP address of the system running this module) and attempt to authenticate. Unfortunately, this module is not able to clean up after itself. The service and payload file listed in the output will need to be manually removed after access has been gained. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description, so the services list can become cluttered after repeated exploitation. The SMB authentication relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia. On November 11th 2008 Microsoft released bulletin MS08-068. This bulletin includes a patch which prevents the relaying of challenge keys back to the host which issued them, preventing this exploit from working in the default configuration. It is still possible to set the SMBHOST parameter to a third-party host that the victim is authorized to access, but the ""reflection"" attack has been effectively broken. As of Feb 2022 - this module does not support SMB 1."
exploit,windows/smb/smb_rras_erraticgopher,"This module exploits an overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) to execute code as SYSTEM. The RRAS DCERPC endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users via SMBv1 browser named pipe on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP hosts; however, this module targets Windows Server 2003 only. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe, a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. The module has been successfully tested on: Windows Server 2003 SP0 (x86); Windows Server 2003 SP1 (x86); Windows Server 2003 SP2 (x86); and Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 (x86)."
exploit,windows/smb/smb_shadow,"This module will intercept direct SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to autheticate to another host on the local area network. SMB Direct Session takeover is a combination of previous attacks. This module is dependent on an external ARP spoofer. The builtin ARP spoofer was not providing sufficient host discovery. Bettercap v1.6.2 was used during the development of this module. The original SMB relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia."
exploit,windows/smb/timbuktu_plughntcommand_bof,This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Timbuktu Pro version <= 8.6.6 in a pretty novel way. This exploit requires two connections. The first connection is used to leak stack data using the buffer overflow to overwrite the nNumberOfBytesToWrite argument. By supplying a large value for this argument it is possible to cause Timbuktu to reply to the initial request with leaked stack data. Using this data allows for reliable exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability. Props to Infamous41d for helping in finding this exploitation path. The second connection utilizes the data from the data leak to accurately exploit the stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. TODO: hdm suggested using meterpreter's migration capability and restarting the process for multishot exploitation.

exploit,windows/tftp/distinct_tftp_traversal,"This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the TFTP Server component of Distinct Intranet Servers version 3.10 which allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the server file system, resulting in code execution under the context of 'SYSTEM'. This module has been tested successfully on TFTP Server version 3.10 on Windows XP SP3 (EN)."
exploit,windows/tftp/dlink_long_filename,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in D-Link TFTP 1.0. By sending a request for an overly long file name, an attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code. For best results, use bind payloads with nonx (No NX)."
exploit,windows/tftp/futuresoft_transfermode,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 product. By sending an overly long transfer-mode string, we were able to overwrite both the SEH and the saved EIP. A subsequent write-exception that will occur allows the transferring of execution to our shellcode via the overwritten SEH. This module has been tested against Windows 2000 Professional and for some reason does not seem to work against Windows 2000 Server (could not trigger the overflow at all)."
exploit,windows/tftp/netdecision_tftp_traversal,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in NetDecision 4.2 TFTP server. The software contains a directory traversal vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary file to the file system, which results in code execution under the context of user executing the TFTP Server."
exploit,windows/tftp/opentftp_error_code,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4. The vulnerable condition triggers when the TFTP opcode is configured as an error packet, the TFTP service will then format the message using a sprintf() function, which causes an overflow, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. The offset (to EIP) is specific to how the TFTP was started (as a 'Stand Alone', or 'Service'). By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the default configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's installation."
exploit,windows/tftp/quick_tftp_pro_mode,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Quick TFTP Pro server product. MS Update KB926436 screws up the opcode address being used in oledlg.dll resulting in a DoS. This is a port of a sploit by Mati ""muts"" Aharoni."
exploit,windows/tftp/tftpd32_long_filename,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in TFTPD32 version 2.21 and prior. By sending a request for an overly long file name to the tftpd32 server, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system."
exploit,windows/tftp/tftpdwin_long_filename,"This module exploits the ProSysInfo TFTPDWIN threaded TFTP Server. By sending an overly long file name to the tftpd.exe server, the stack can be overwritten."
exploit,windows/tftp/tftpserver_wrq_bof,"This module exploits a vulnerability found in TFTP Server 1.4 ST. The flaw is due to the way TFTP handles the filename parameter extracted from a WRQ request. The server will append the user-supplied filename to TFTP server binary's path without any bounds checking, and then attempt to check this path with a fopen(). Since this isn't a valid file path, fopen() returns null, which allows the corrupted data to be used in a strcmp() function, causing an access violation. Since the offset is sensitive to how the TFTP server is launched, you must know in advance if your victim machine launched the TFTP as a 'Service' or 'Standalone' , and then manually select your target accordingly. A successful attempt will lead to remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM if run as a service, or the user if run as a standalone. A failed attempt will result a denial-of-service."
exploit,windows/tftp/threectftpsvc_long_mode,"This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in 3CTftpSvc 2.0.1. By sending a specially crafted packet with an overly long mode field, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system."
exploit,windows/unicenter/cam_log_security,This module exploits a vulnerability in the CA CAM service by passing a long parameter to the log_security() function. The CAM service is part of TNG Unicenter. This module has been tested on Unicenter v3.1.
exploit,windows/vnc/realvnc_client,This module exploits a buffer overflow in RealVNC 3.3.7 (vncviewer.exe).
exploit,windows/vnc/ultravnc_client,This module exploits a buffer overflow in UltraVNC Win32 Viewer 1.0.1 Release.
exploit,windows/vnc/ultravnc_viewer_bof,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in UltraVNC Viewer 1.0.2 Release. If a malicious server responds to a client connection indicating a minor protocol version of 14 or 16, a 32-bit integer is subsequently read from the TCP stream by the client and directly provided as the trusted size for further reading from the TCP stream into a 1024-byte character array on the stack."
exploit,windows/vnc/winvnc_http_get,"This module exploits a buffer overflow in the AT&T WinVNC version <= v3.3.3r7 web server. When debugging mode with logging is enabled (non-default), an overly long GET request can overwrite the stack. This exploit does not work well with VNC payloads!"
exploit,windows/vpn/safenet_ike_11,This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Safenet SoftRemote IKE IreIKE.exe service. When sending a specially crafted udp packet to port 62514 an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. This module has been tested with Juniper NetScreen-Remote 10.8.0 (Build 20) using windows/meterpreter/reverse_ord_tcp payloads.
exploit,windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec,"This module uses valid credentials to login to the WinRM service and execute a payload. It has two available methods for payload delivery: Powershell 2.0 and VBS CmdStager. The module will check if Powershell 2.0 is available, and if so uses that method. Otherwise it falls back to the VBS CmdStager which is less stealthy. IMPORTANT: If targeting an x64 system with the Powershell method you MUST select an x64 payload. An x86 payload will never return."
exploit,windows/wins/ms04_045_wins,This module exploits an arbitrary memory write flaw in the WINS service. This exploit has been tested against Windows 2000 only.
